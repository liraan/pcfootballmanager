# Contributing

Thanks for wanting to help. This project is documentation-first, and **good documentation is the contribution** right now. Code exists (L0 implemented), but documentation and review are just as important.

---

## Current state

The live state of the project — crates, tests, ADRs, L0 modules, last commit — is the repository itself: `git log`, `git ls-files`, `cargo test`. [`docs/context/REPO-SNAPSHOT.md`](docs/context/REPO-SNAPSHOT.md) is a **briefing**, not authority; it may lag behind. For ADR status, see [`STRUCTURE.md`](STRUCTURE.md) §5.

If you are new, read the files in the order below before opening a PR.

---

## Read in this order

1. [`README.md`](README.md) — what the project is
2. [`specs/00-foundations.md`](specs/00-foundations.md) — the doctrine. **Non-negotiable.** *(v2.0, pillar 1 revised by ADR-013.)*
3. [`STRUCTURE.md`](STRUCTURE.md) — how the repo works
4. [`specs/_index.md`](specs/_index.md) — what exists, what's missing
5. [`docs/GLOSSARY.md`](docs/GLOSSARY.md) — the terms used across the spec
6. [`docs/PLUGIN_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`](docs/PLUGIN_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md) — how to write a module (and why the simulation/rendering split matters)
7. [`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/) — the decisions, including open ones

## The rules

### One change per PR

- One cell. One ADR. One crate. One fix. No bundling.
- If a change touches two cells, two PRs.
- If a change requires an ADR, the ADR goes in a separate PR *before* the cell change.

### Frontmatter is mandatory

Every cell has it. See `STRUCTURE.md` §4. No frontmatter, no merge.

### The doctrine wins

If your change contradicts `00-foundations`, you have two options:

1. Change the change so it fits the doctrine.
2. Write a doctrine ADR that amends the doctrine, get it accepted, then change the cell.

You cannot silently contradict the doctrine.

### The levels matter

The specification is concentric (L0 → L1 → L2 → L3). A cell at level N may read the **output** of a level `< N` cell, never its internals, and never depend on a level `> N`. See `STRUCTURE.md` §2.

If your change requires a level N cell to depend on a level `> N` cell, the change is wrong. Discuss it in an issue first.

### Cite sources

Every factual claim gets a source. If you can't find one, say "unverified". Do not invent.

### Explain the WHY

A cell that says *what* without *why* is a draft. The `design_note` fields exist for this. Use them.

### If you spot an error, say so

Including in AI-drafted text. Especially in AI-drafted text. The AI disclosure in the README is not decoration — it's a warning.

## Revise a cell

1. **Bump the version** in the frontmatter.
   - Minor (`1.0 → 1.1`) for clarifications, typo fixes, added examples.
   - Major (`1.0 → 2.0`) for changes that affect downstream cells.
2. **If major, write an ADR first.** The ADR explains why. It's referenced from the cell.
3. **Archive the previous version** in `archive/` if the change is structural.
4. **Update `last_updated`.**
5. **Update `referenced_by`** in downstream cells if the dependency changed.
6. **Open a PR with one cell.**
7. **If the change is a status transition** (e.g. `draft → ratified`), update both `specs/_index.md` and the overview cell of the level (`00-overview.md` for L0).

---

## Add a cell

1. **Pick the level** (L0, L1, L2, L3) the new cell belongs to. See `STRUCTURE.md` §2.
2. **Check the dependency rules.** A level N cell may not depend on level `> N`.
3. **Create the directory** `specs/L{N}-{kebab-name}/`.
4. **Add `00-overview.md`** with the frontmatter (see `STRUCTURE.md` §4). The overview is the "border" of the cell: contracts, dependencies, DoD, risks.
5. **Add the sub-cells** as files inside the directory.
6. **Add a row to `specs/_index.md`.**
7. **Open a PR with one cell.**

A cell without:

- §0 Purpose
- Specification sections
- Definition of Done
- Risks & Mitigations

…is a draft. That's fine, mark it `status: draft` and merge it as a draft. But say so.

---

## The ADR process

An ADR captures **one decision**. It is immutable once accepted. To change a decision, write a new ADR that supersedes it.

### Propose an ADR

1. Copy `docs/adr/000-template.md` to `docs/adr/NNN-your-title.md`.
2. Fill in Context, Options, Decision (proposed), Consequences.
3. Set `status: proposed`.
4. Open a PR. Discussion happens on the PR.
5. When there's rough consensus, a maintainer merges it with `status: accepted`.

### Review an ADR

You don't need to be a maintainer to review. If the options are unbalanced, say so. If the decision is wrong, say so. If the ADR contradicts the doctrine, say so — that's the most important review you can do.

### Open ADRs block code

If an ADR is `proposed` and touches an area, **no code is written in that area until it's accepted**. This is how we avoid the "we'll decide later" trap.

**For the current list of open ADRs, and what each one blocks, see [`STRUCTURE.md`](STRUCTURE.md) §5 ("Current ADR status").** That table is the single source of truth. It is **not duplicated here**, to avoid drift between the two files.

**Current state:** for ADR status, see [`STRUCTURE.md`](STRUCTURE.md) §5 (the single source of truth). For a briefing on the repository, see [`docs/context/REPO-SNAPSHOT.md`](docs/context/REPO-SNAPSHOT.md) (not authority). The reading guide for ADR-012 and ADR-013 is [`docs/PLUGINS-WORLDS-READING-GUIDE.md`](docs/PLUGINS-WORLDS-READING-GUIDE.md).
---

## Code

The L0 specification is complete and ratified, and L0 is implemented (9 crates, 103 tests). Code contributions are welcome, but they must follow `docs/PLUGIN_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`.

When you write code:

- `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` clean
- Tests for every feature
- Property tests for invariants (money conservation, squad invariants)
- Golden tests for determinism
- No `unwrap()`/`expect()`/`panic!` in simulation paths
- No dependency without an ADR justifying it
- Public API documented
- `catch_unwind` at every FFI entry point (ADR-004)
- No public field on `GroundTruth`, no `Serialize`, custom `Debug` (ADR-003)
- The simulation/rendering split is respected: `simulate_match` is the only simulation, renderers are thin wrappers (see `docs/PLUGIN_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` §3)
- Test scenarios (`pcfm_testkit::Scenario`) for new features. See `docs/PLUGIN_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` §11.

- [ ] The WHY is explained, not just the what
- [ ] One change per PR

- [ ] `specs/_index.md` updated if a cell was added
- [ ] If it is a status transition, the level's overview cell is updated too
- [ ] No contradiction with existing cells (or the contradiction is the point of the PR)
- [ ] Language is English (or a translation in `locales/`)
- [ ] No `License: Proprietary` string anywhere
- [ ] No `TBD` left in a field that should have a value
- [ ] If it is code, `docs/PLUGIN_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` is respected (plane separation, simulation/rendering split, no dependency without an ADR)
- [ ] If it is a test scenario, it is registered via `pcfm-test-runner/src/features/register_all` (see `docs/PLUGIN_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` §11)
