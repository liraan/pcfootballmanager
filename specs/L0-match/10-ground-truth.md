<!--
  MAINTAINER NOTE: ADR-003 is accepted (option B). This cell is now `ratified`.
  It exists because the `pcfm-hidden` API was scattered across L0.03 §3.2,
  L0.04 §1, L0.05 §2.3 and ADR-003. A reader who wanted to understand "what
  can pcfm-hidden do?" had to read four files. This cell centralises the API
  and the contract. It does NOT introduce new behaviour; it documents
  behaviour that already exists in the other cells.

  This cell does NOT define Plane A. It defines the *access* to Plane A.
  The definition of what is in Plane A is in 00-foundations §3.
  The definition of the Player entity is in L0.03. This cell is the bridge.

# L0.10 — Ground Truth

## 0. Purpose

Define the **public API of `pcfm-hidden`**, the crate that contains Plane A (Ground Truth). Specify what the crate exposes, what it does not expose, and the contract that the match engine (`L0.04`) and the random events cell (`L0.08`) must respect.

This cell does not define the entities (those are in `L0.03`). It does not define the match engine (that is `L0.04`). It defines the **only door** through which Plane A can be reached.

**Status: `ratified`.** ADR-003 (option B) is accepted. The API is the implementation contract.

## 1. Context and dependencies

- Depends on `00-foundations` (the doctrine, §3 and §5), `L0.01` (RNG, because `GroundTruth` is seeded from it), `L0.03` (entities, because `GroundTruth` is indexed by `PlayerId`)
- Read by `L0.04` (match engine), `L0.07` (save reconstruction), and `L0.08` (random events)
- Written by `L3-generator` *(planned)*, which creates `GroundTruth` from a world seed
- Implemented in the crate `pcfm-hidden`
- **Never** serialised. The save (`L0.07`) reconstructs `GroundTruth` from `(world_seed, match_id)` + the command log. See `L0.07` §2.6.

## 2. Specification

### 2.1 The type

```rust
// pcfm-hidden, public API
pub struct GroundTruth {
    // private fields: no public accessor
}

impl GroundTruth {
    /// Create a new `GroundTruth` from a world seed and a match id.
    /// Called by `pcfm-gen` (or by the test harness). Not called by the engine.
    pub fn new(world_seed: u64, match_id: MatchId) -> Self;

    // Resolution functions — the only way to read Plane A
    pub fn resolve_duel(&mut self, ctx: DuelContext) -> DuelOutcome;
    pub fn resolve_shot(&mut self, ctx: ShotContext) -> ShotOutcome;
    pub fn resolve_pass(&mut self, ctx: PassContext) -> PassOutcome;
    pub fn resolve_pressure(&mut self, ctx: PressureContext) -> PressureOutcome;
    pub fn resolve_injury_risk(&mut self, ctx: InjuryContext) -> InjuryOutcome;
    pub fn resolve_save(&mut self, ctx: SaveContext) -> SaveOutcome;
    pub fn resolve_set_piece(&mut self, ctx: SetPieceContext) -> SetPieceOutcome;

    // Observation drain — the only readable output of Plane A
    pub fn drain_observations(&mut self) -> Vec<ObservationEvent>;
}
```

That is the entire public surface. No fields, no `latent_attributes()` getter, no `Debug` that prints internals, no `Serialize`.

### 2.2 The context types

Each `resolve_*` takes a context struct and returns an outcome struct. The contexts are **observed** data (Plane B/C) plus the `PlayerId`s involved. The outcomes are **observed** data (Plane B). The engine passes context, receives outcome, and never sees the latent values that produced the outcome.

```rust
pub struct DuelContext {
    pub attacker: PlayerId,
    pub defender: PlayerId,
    pub duel_type: DuelType,            // Aerial, Ground, WithGoalkeeper, Brawl
    pub pitch_position: (f32, f32),     // observed, from L0.04
    pub modifiers: ContextModifiers,    // observed, from L0.09
}

pub struct DuelOutcome {
    pub winner: PlayerId,
    pub ball_retained: bool,
    pub foul_committed: Option<PlayerId>,
    pub injury_risk_modifier: f32,      // observed scalar, not a latent
    pub temperament_modifier: f32,      // observed scalar, not a latent
    pub cause: CauseTrace,              // observed explanation
}
```

The same shape applies to the other resolution types: `ShotContext` / `ShotOutcome`, `PassContext` / `PassOutcome`, and so on. Each context carries **observed** state and `PlayerId`s. Each outcome carries **observed** results and a `CauseTrace`.

**Rule:** the `CauseTrace` in an outcome references **observed** values (e.g. `fatigue = 0.72`), never latent values. If the latent `finishing_close` was used to resolve a shot, the cause trace says `finishing_observed = 15`, not `finishing_close = 17`. This is the same rule as `L0.05` §2.3.

### 2.3 The contract

The following rules are enforced by the type system (no public fields, no `Serialize`, no `Debug` that leaks) and by review.

1. **Only `resolve_*` and `drain_observations` are public.** No other method on `GroundTruth` returns data. `new` is public but only returns `Self`.
2. **`GroundTruth` is not `Serialize`.** It cannot end up in a save by accident.
3. **`GroundTruth` has no public fields.** A future field is a breaking change and requires an ADR.
4. **`GroundTruth` has a custom `Debug`** that prints `GroundTruth { .. }` and nothing else. No latent value ever appears in a log.
5. **The engine holds `&mut GroundTruth`.** It cannot clone it, cannot share it across threads within a match, cannot store it in a field that outlives `simulate`. The borrow checker enforces this.
6. **The engine does not construct `GroundTruth`.** Construction is the responsibility of `pcfm-gen` (or the test harness). The engine receives it as a parameter.

### 2.4 What `pcfm-hidden` is not allowed to do

- It cannot return a `Player` with latent fields. If the engine needs a player, it uses the `Player` from `L0.03`, not a `Player` from `pcfm-hidden`.
- It cannot return a raw latent value. `fn finishing(&self) -> f32` is forbidden. If the engine needs to know "how good is this player at finishing", it calls `resolve_shot` and receives an outcome, not a number.
- It cannot be `Serialize`d. See §2.3 rule 2.
- It cannot be logged in full. See §2.3 rule 4.
- It cannot be constructed by the engine. See §2.3 rule 6.

### 2.5 Why this API, and not a field access

This is the whole point of ADR-003, option B. If `pcfm-hidden` exposed `player.latent.finishing`, the engine would read the latent and decide the outcome itself. That is the **circularity trap**: the outcome would be a deterministic function of the latent, and the gap between "how good the player is" and "what the player did" would collapse.

By exposing only `resolve_shot`, the crate keeps the gap: the engine asks "does this shot go in?", receives "yes/no" plus a cause trace, and cannot reverse-engineer the latent from the answer (the answer has noise). The engine is an orchestrator, not a calculator. The latent lives only in `pcfm-hidden`, and the engine cannot see it.

The cost is verbosity: one call per resolution type. The benefit is that the Three Planes doctrine is enforced by the compiler, not by review. See ADR-003 for the full trade-off.

### 2.6 The `drain_observations` method

`drain_observations` returns the observations accumulated by `GroundTruth` since the last drain. These are `ObservationEvent`s (Plane B), already stripped of any latent value. They are the bridge between "what `pcfm-hidden` computed internally" and "what `pcfm-stats` can store".

Typical use: at the end of each tick, the engine calls `drain_observations()` and forwards the events to `L0.05` (which appends them to the `EventChain`). The engine does not interpret them; it only forwards them.

## 3. Data model

`GroundTruth`, `DuelContext`, `DuelOutcome`, `ShotContext`, `ShotOutcome`, `PassContext`, `PassOutcome`, `PressureContext`, `PressureOutcome`, `InjuryContext`, `InjuryOutcome`, `SaveContext`, `SaveOutcome`, `SetPieceContext`, `SetPieceOutcome`, `ObservationEvent`, `DuelType`.

The full schema of each context/outcome is defined in `pcfm-hidden`'s source, not here. This cell defines the **shape** of the API, not the field-by-field schema of each context (that is an implementation detail that can evolve without breaking the contract, as long as the public types stay opaque to the engine).

## 4. Edge cases

- **`resolve_*` returns an error**: panic (caught at the call site per ADR-004), the match is abandoned, the save is preserved. Same as `L0.04` §4.
- **`drain_observations` called twice in a row**: the second call returns an empty `Vec`. No event is duplicated.
- **`drain_observations` not called for a long time**: the internal buffer grows. The engine must call it at least once per tick (see `L0.04` §2.2). A buffer overflow is a bug.
- **`GroundTruth::new` with the same `(world_seed, match_id)`**: returns the same initial state. This is what makes the save reconstruct-able. See `L0.07` §2.6.
- **`GroundTruth` used across two matches**: forbidden. Each match has its own `GroundTruth`. The engine cannot reuse one.
- **A `resolve_*` call happens after the match has ended**: forbidden. The engine stops calling `resolve_*` when the match ends. Any call after `FullTime` is a bug.

## 5. Definition of Done

- [x] ADR-003 accepted (option B)
- [ ] `GroundTruth` has no public fields
- [ ] `GroundTruth` is not `Serialize`
- [ ] `GroundTruth` has a custom `Debug` that prints `GroundTruth { .. }`
- [ ] `GroundTruth::new` is public; all other methods are `resolve_*`, `drain_observations`
- [ ] No getter returns a latent value (grep for `fn .*-> *f32` on `GroundTruth` that is not a `resolve_*`)
- [ ] The engine holds `&mut GroundTruth`, not `GroundTruth`
- [ ] `drain_observations` returns `ObservationEvent`s with no latent fields
- [ ] Test: two `GroundTruth::new(seed, id)` with the same arguments produce the same initial state
- [ ] Test: `drain_observations` called twice returns the same events the first time and empty the second time
- [ ] Test: a `GroundTruth` cannot be serialised (compile-fail test)

## 6. Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| A latent getter is added "just for debugging" | Critical | Review + grep in CI; ADR-003 enforcement |
| `GroundTruth` ends up in a save via a field of another struct | Critical | Type: not `Serialize`; test: compile-fail |
| The engine constructs `GroundTruth` itself | High | `new` is `pub` but the engine has no `world_seed`; the borrow checker makes it impossible |
| The API is too coarse and forces the engine to be a calculator | Medium | The API can be extended with new `resolve_*` types; the rule is "one call per resolution", not "one call per sub-model" |
| The API is too fine and the engine becomes a thin wrapper | Medium | Fewer, larger `resolve_*` methods are preferred; the granularity is a design choice, documented per method |
| `drain_observations` is not called often enough | Medium | The engine must call it at least once per tick; a test verifies this |
| `GroundTruth` is cloned to parallelise a match | High | `&mut GroundTruth` in the context; no `Clone` impl; the borrow checker prevents it |
