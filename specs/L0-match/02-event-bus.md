# L0.02 — Event Bus

## 0. Purpose

A deterministic, in-process event bus. The mechanism by which the match engine, the statistics collector, the narrative generator, and the UI communicate without coupling.

**No subscriber depends on the order of arrival.** Events are dispatched in insertion order, deterministically.

## 1. Context and dependencies

- Depends only on `00-foundations`
- Used by `04-match-engine` (producer), `05-match-events` (consumer), `06-match-output` (consumer)
- Used later by L1 and L2 (e.g. `L2-psyche` reacts to events)

## 2. Specification

### 2.1 Structure

```rust
pub struct EventBus {
    queue: Vec<QueuedEvent>,
    handlers: BTreeMap<EventKindId, Vec<HandlerRef>>,
}

pub struct QueuedEvent {
    pub seq: u64,            // insertion sequence, monotonically increasing
    pub kind: EventKindId,
    pub payload: EventPayload,
}

impl EventBus {
    pub fn publish(&mut self, kind: EventKindId, payload: EventPayload);
    pub fn dispatch_all(&mut self) -> Vec<DispatchedEvent>;
    pub fn subscribe(&mut self, kind: EventKindId, handler: HandlerRef);
}
```

### 2.2 Ordering guarantees

- Events are dispatched in **insertion order** (`seq`).
- Handlers for the same event are called in **registration order** (a stable order, not a `HashMap` order).
- New events published during dispatch are queued and processed in the next dispatch cycle. **No recursion in the same cycle.**
- The bus is **single-threaded** per match. Parallelism, if needed, is at the match level (multiple matches), not within a match.

### 2.3 Event kinds

Event kinds are registered at compile time via an enum or a registry. Suggested enum:

```rust
pub enum MatchEventKind {
    KickOff,
    Tick,                    // one per simulation tick
    Shot,
    Pass,
    Duel,
    Foul,
    Card,
    Injury,
    Substitution,
    Goal,
    HalfTime,
    FullTime,
    RandomEvent,             // from L0.08
    ContextChange,           // from L0.09
}
```

Extensible via `L3-registry` (pack-provided event kinds). L0 uses only the enum above.

### 2.4 What is forbidden

- Dispatching in parallel within a match
- Handlers that mutate the bus during dispatch (they must queue)
- Handlers that depend on `HashMap` iteration order
- Handlers that read `pcfm-hidden` directly (they must go through the match engine)

### 2.5 Replay compatibility

The event bus log is part of the save. Reloading a save replays the events in order, producing the same state. This is tested in `07-save-minimal`.

## 3. Data model

`EventBus`, `QueuedEvent`, `DispatchedEvent`, `EventKindId`, `HandlerRef`, `EventPayload`.

## 4. Edge cases

- **Publishing with no subscribers**: event is queued and dispatched, no handler called. Not an error.
- **Handler panics**: caught at the handler boundary, logged, the event is marked as `failed` in the log. The match continues. See [`../../docs/adr/004-panic-strategy-ffi.md`](../../docs/adr/004-panic-strategy-ffi.md).
- **Handler queues a new event of the same kind**: allowed, processed next cycle. No infinite loop possible because each cycle processes the queue of the previous cycle, not a growing queue.
- **Dispatch with empty queue**: no-op, returns empty vec.
- **Event bus reused between matches**: forbidden. Each match has its own bus.

## 5. Definition of Done

- [ ] `EventBus` implemented with `BTreeMap` handlers
- [ ] Ordering guaranteed by `seq`
- [ ] Replay test: publish 1000 events, dispatch, reload, re-dispatch, same output
- [ ] Test: adding a handler for an existing event does not change the result of other handlers
- [ ] Panic isolation tested
- [ ] No use of `HashMap` in the bus
- [ ] Event kinds enum documented

## 6. Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Non-deterministic handler order | Critical | `Vec` of handlers, registration order |
| Recursion in dispatch | High | Explicit "next cycle" queueing |
| Panic takes down the match | High | `catch_unwind` at handler boundary (ADR-004) |
| Event kinds become a "god enum" | Medium | L3 registry allows pack extension; L0 enum is fixed |
