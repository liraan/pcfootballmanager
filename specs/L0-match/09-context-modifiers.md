<!--
  MAINTAINER NOTE: this cell is "just a struct", and that's the point. It is the
  CONTRACT between L0 and L2. L0 reads it. L2 writes it. L0 never asks "why is
  squad_chemistry 0.3". That's the whole architecture in one file. If you're
  tempted to add a field, ask: does the match engine actually use it? If no,
  don't add it here.

  Also: every field is OBSERVED. No field is a latent. If a producer needs to
  feed a latent-derived value, it must be pre-computed (e.g. squad_chemistry
  is derived from individual psychologies in L2-psyche, not computed here).

# L0.09 — Context Modifiers

## 0. Purpose

Define **how external state enters the match engine**. The match engine reads a clean `ContextModifiers` struct. It does **not** read `L2-psyche`, `L2-crowd`, or `L1-world` directly.

This is the cell that keeps L0 independent from L1/L2 while still allowing their effects to reach the pitch.

## 1. Context and dependencies

- Depends on `00-foundations`, `L0.03`
- Read by `L0.04` (engine) and `L0.08` (random events)
- **Produced** by L1/L2 (e.g. `L2-psyche` sets `squad_chemistry`, `L2-crowd` sets `crowd_hostility`)
- This cell **defines the shape**; the values come from outside
- No field is computed inside L0. The engine reads, it does not derive.

## 2. Specification

### 2.1 The struct

```rust
pub struct ContextModifiers {
    // Crowd
    pub crowd_hostility: f32,           // 0.0–1.0, from L2-crowd
    pub crowd_support: f32,             // 0.0–1.0, from L2-crowd
    pub crowd_expectation: f32,         // 0.0–1.0, from L2-crowd

    // Manager
    pub manager_tactical_clarity: f32,  // 0.0–1.0, from L2-tactics
    pub manager_arousal_style: f32,     // 0.0–1.0, from L1-roster

    // Squad
    pub squad_chemistry: f32,           // 0.0–1.0, from L2-psyche
    pub squad_experience: f32,          // 0.0–1.0, from L1-roster

    // Referee
    pub referee_strictness: f32,        // 0.0–1.0, from L0.03
    pub referee_consistency: f32,       // 0.0–1.0, from L0.03

    // Environment
    pub weather_severity: f32,          // 0.0–1.0, from L0.03
    pub pitch_wear: f32,                // 0.0–1.0, from L0.03

    // Optional
    pub derby_intensity: f32,           // 0.0–1.0, from L2-world (if derby)
    pub relegation_pressure: f32,       // 0.0–1.0, from L1-season
    pub title_race_pressure: f32,       // 0.0–1.0, from L1-season
}
```

### 2.2 How the engine uses them

The engine applies modifiers to its internal calculations:

- `crowd_hostility` → increases `pressure_load` for the away team, increases `acute_arousal`
- `crowd_support` → increases `confidence` for the home team
- `manager_tactical_clarity` → reduces variance of micro-decisions
- `squad_chemistry` → reduces probability of relational random events
- `referee_strictness` → increases card probability
- `weather_severity` → increases error rates, reduces pass completion
- `derby_intensity` → increases random event probability (brawls, cards)
- `pitch_wear` → increases injury risk modifier, reduces pass completion
- `relegation_pressure` / `title_race_pressure` → increases `pressure_load` for both teams, magnitude depends on the field's value

**Rule:** the engine treats these as **inputs**. It does not compute them, does not know their origin. `L2-psyche` could set `squad_chemistry = 0.3` because of a fight in training; the engine just sees `0.3`.

### 2.3 Default values at L0

At L0 (sandbox match), all modifiers default to neutral:

```rust
impl Default for ContextModifiers {
    fn default() -> Self {
        Self {
            crowd_hostility: 0.5,
            crowd_support: 0.5,
            crowd_expectation: 0.5,
            manager_tactical_clarity: 0.7,
            manager_arousal_style: 0.5,
            squad_chemistry: 0.7,
            squad_experience: 0.5,
            referee_strictness: 0.5,
            referee_consistency: 0.7,
            weather_severity: 0.0,
            pitch_wear: 0.1,
            derby_intensity: 0.0,
            relegation_pressure: 0.0,
            title_race_pressure: 0.0,
        }
    }
}
```

At L0, the engine runs with `default()`. At L1+, the values come from the surrounding modules.

### 2.4 What is **not** here

- **Who** produces the values (L1-season, L2-psyche, L2-crowd, etc.)
- **Why** a value is what it is (that is the producer's concern)
- **How** to compute `squad_chemistry` from individual psychologies (L2-psyche)
- **Latents**: no field is a latent. If a producer wants to feed a latent-derived value, it must pre-compute it into an observed scalar (e.g. `squad_chemistry` is derived in L2-psyche, not here).

This cell is **only the contract**: the shape, the ranges, the semantics.

## 3. Data model

`ContextModifiers`.

The struct is `Serialize`/`Deserialize` (it is saved with the match; it contains no latents). It is `Clone` and `Copy` (it is small).

## 4. Edge cases

- **Value outside [0,1]**: clamped, logged
- **`weather_severity = 1.0`**: match abandoned (rare)
- **`crowd_hostility = 1.0`**: match paused, possible abandonment
- **All defaults**: sandbox match, no external state
- **A field is `NaN`**: rejected at construction; the match does not start
- **A field changes mid-match**: not supported at L0 (modifiers are fixed at kickoff); mid-match changes are an L2 feature (e.g. a goal changes crowd mood). L2 recomputes the modifiers and passes the new struct to the engine at a defined boundary (half-time at L0; continuous at L1+).

## 5. Definition of Done

- [ ] `ContextModifiers` defined with ranges documented
- [ ] Defaults set to neutral
- [ ] Each modifier documented with its effect on the engine
- [ ] No modifier computed inside L0
- [ ] `Serialize`/`Deserialize` (no latents in the save)
- [ ] Test: sandbox match with defaults → no crash
- [ ] Test: extreme values → match completes (or abandons, for weather/hostility)
- [ ] Test: `NaN` in any field → rejected at construction
- [ ] No L1/L2 type imported in L0 (CI check)

## 6. Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| L0 depends on L2 type | Critical | Type check in CI: no `L2-*` import in `L0-*` |
| Modifier explosion | Medium | Closed struct at L0; extension via `L3-registry` (future) |
| Modifier values arbitrary | Medium | Producer is responsible; L0 only checks range and `NaN` |
| Mid-match modifier changes | Medium | Not supported at L0; documented as L2 feature |
| A modifier is added "just in case" | Medium | Rule: a field is added only if the engine reads it in at least one place |
