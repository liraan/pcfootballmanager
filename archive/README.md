# Archive

This folder contains **superseded documents**. Nothing here is maintained. Nothing here is deleted.

The archive exists for traceability: so that "why did we decide X?" can be answered years later, even after the decision has been replaced.

## What goes here

| File | What it is | Superseded by |
|---|---|---|
| `Prompt_Master_v5.md` | The v5 doctrine (pre-statistics) | `Prompt_Master_v6.md` |
| `Prompt_Master_v6.md` | The v6 doctrine (statistics added) | `Prompt_Master_v7.md` |
| `Prompt_Master_v7.md` | The v7 doctrine (CA/PA removed, Three Planes explicit) | `specs/00-foundations.md` (v1.0) |
| `00-foundations-vX.Y.md` | Previous versions of the doctrine | current `specs/00-foundations.md` |
| `01-architecture-vX.Y.md` | Previous versions | current module |
| `legacy/01-architecture.md` | The original Italian `01-architecture.md`, from the flat 25-module structure | `docs/MIGRATION-01-04.md` |
| `legacy/02-registry.md` | The original Italian `02-registry.md` | `docs/MIGRATION-01-04.md` |
| `legacy/03-pack-system.md` | The original Italian `03-pack-system.md` | `docs/MIGRATION-01-04.md` |
| `legacy/04-data-model.md` | The original Italian `04-data-model.md` | `docs/MIGRATION-01-04.md` |

*(The rows above are the planned contents. Some of them do not exist yet. See "Current contents" below.)*

## Current contents

As of 2026-10-25, the archive is **empty**. The three Prompt Master versions and the four legacy modules are pending recovery (see [`../docs/MIGRATION-01-04.md`](../docs/MIGRATION-01-04.md)).

Once recovered, they will be placed here. Until then, the files are recoverable from git history:

```bash
# Recover a legacy module
git log --all --full-history -- modules/01-architecture.md
git show <commit>:modules/01-architecture.md > archive/legacy/01-architecture.md
```

## Rules

1. **Read-only.** Do not edit archived files. They are snapshots, not living documents.
2. **Never deleted.** An archived file stays in the archive forever. If it becomes irrelevant, it stays anyway: history is not a curation exercise.
3. **Naming.** `original-name-vX.Y.md`, matching the version in the frontmatter (if the archived file has a frontmatter). For files without a frontmatter, use the version in the filename, or the commit date.
4. **One subfolder per concept.** `legacy/` for the four pre-concentric modules. `prompts/` for the Prompt Master versions. `doctrine/` for previous `00-foundations` versions. Do not mix.
5. **Update this README when you add a file.** The table at the top must reflect the actual contents. A stale table is worse than no table.

## How to archive a document

When a document is superseded by a newer version:

1. **Copy** (do not move) the old version to `archive/<subfolder>/<name>-vX.Y.md`.
2. **Move** the old version out of its original location (delete it from `specs/` or `docs/`).
3. **Update this README** with the new row in the table at the top.
4. **Add an entry to `CHANGELOG.md`** under "Removed" or "Changed", referencing the archive file.
5. **In the new document**, add `supersedes: "<archived-id>"` in its frontmatter (if it has one).

For the doctrine specifically (`specs/00-foundations.md`), the archive subfolder is `archive/doctrine/`. For the prompt masters, it is `archive/prompts/`. For the legacy flat modules, it is `archive/legacy/`.

## Planned subfolders

```
archive/
├── README.md                      ← this file
├── prompts/                       ← *(planned)* Prompt Master v5, v6, v7
├── doctrine/                      ← *(planned)* previous 00-foundations versions
└── legacy/                        ← *(planned)* the four Italian flat modules
```

Each subfolder gets its own `README.md` when it is created, listing its contents and the reason each file was archived.

## Why archive instead of delete

Deleting is irreversible and loses context. Archiving:

- **Preserves the "why"** — a decision made three years ago can be explained by reading what was known at the time.
- **Supports audits** — if a user reports a bug that was "fixed" years ago and then reintroduced, the archive shows the original fix.
- **Avoids rewriting history** — git history is linear and lossy; the archive is explicit and readable.

The archive is not a graveyard. It is the project's memory.

<!--
  NOTES FOR FUTURE EDITORS:

  - Keep the "Current contents" section accurate. If the archive is empty, say
    it is empty. If it contains files, list them. A wrong table is a broken
    promise to the reader.
  - Do not add files to the archive without updating the table at the top.
  - Do not delete files from the archive. If a file is truly irrelevant, it
    still stays; the point is traceability, not cleanliness.
  - When you create a subfolder, create its README.md at the same time.
  - This file is linked from:
      - specs/00-foundations.md §8 (as the historical reference, once it
        exists)
      - docs/MIGRATION-01-04.md §5 (as the eventual destination of the
        legacy modules)
    If you move or rename this file, update those links.
