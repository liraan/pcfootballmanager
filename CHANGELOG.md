# Changelog

All notable changes to the **documentation and project structure** are recorded here.

For simulation-behaviour changes, see [`CHANGELOG-SIM.md`](CHANGELOG-SIM.md).
For registry deprecations and migrations, see [`CHANGELOG-REGISTRY.md`](CHANGELOG-REGISTRY.md).

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
This project does not use semantic versioning for the docs; the version of each module is in its own frontmatter.

> **Terminology note (2026-10-25):** the terms are **module** (a directory of the specification, e.g. `L0-match`), **sub-module** (a file inside a module, e.g. `04-match-engine.md`), **plugin** (a Rust crate with a `sheet.toml`, defined in ADR-012). The term **cell** is deprecated. In entries **before** this date, 'cell' means 'module', and 'module' (in the plugin sense) means 'plugin'. In entries **from** this date onwards, the new terminology is used.

## [2026-10-25] — ADR-012 (plugins) and ADR-013 (worlds), proposed

### Added

- **`docs/adr/012-plugins.md`** — proposed. The brick contract: plugin sheet mandatory and validated, behaviour open / metadata closed, conflicts critical (blocked) vs minor (warned), narrative is the modder's responsibility, cause traces have two levels (diegetic + meta), debug UI plugin view.
- **`docs/adr/013-worlds.md`** — proposed. Worlds: LOD = sum of active plugin weights, LOD chosen at save creation and fixed, manifest is part of the save and validated, **local determinism** (same save + same match + same plugin configuration = same result), community plural and aware, meta level visible to the PCFM player, debug UI world view, low LOD is a valid game, low LOD is blind by design, framework understandable without the debug UI.
- **`docs/adr/012-013-reading-guide.md`** — a reading guide for the two ADRs: why they are two, what each covers, the points of contact, what changes in the doctrine.

### Changed

- **`modules/00-foundations.md`**: version 1.3 → **1.4**. **Pillar 1** ("Traceable determinism. Same seed + same inputs = same result. Never compromised.") is marked **under review** (ADR-013, proposed). The pillar text is unchanged; a note says "under review, see ADR-013 (proposed)". §4 (Determinism) gains a **status note**: the scope of the section is under review (global vs local); the rules (named streams, no `HashMap`, golden tests, `SIM_VERSION`) are not under review. The banned-things list (§5) gains a parenthetical on "No compromising determinism for convenience. *(Scope under review, see §4.)*". §8 (References) gains links to ADR-012, ADR-013, and the plugin developer guide.
- **`modules/_index.md`**: version 2.5 → **2.7**. The "Plugins and worlds" section is rewritten as **prose + link to the ADR status table** (no duplicate table). The "Doctrine" section, "Current state", and "Doctrine compliance" are updated to say the doctrine is **v1.4** and the modules conform to **v1.1** (the last invariant-changing version). "Open ADRs" is still listed here (single source of truth for the project map). ADR status table updated with 012 and 013 (both `proposed`).
- **`STRUCTURE.md`**: version 1.5 → **1.6**. §4 (Module Frontmatter) gains an explicit note that `conforms_to` means **"verified against"**, not "compatible with". §5 (Current ADR status) updated with 012 and 013, and a **note on pillar 1** (ADR-013, if ratified, will supersede it). §3 (Current state) shows the code (6 crates, 103 tests). §9 (What Packs Can and Cannot Extend) gains a note on the plugin system (once ratified).
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`**: version 1.1 → **1.2**. The ADR status table is **removed** (it was a duplicate of `STRUCTURE.md` §5); the file now links to `STRUCTURE.md` §5 as the single source of truth. "Current state" is corrected ("10 ADRs exist: 5 accepted, 5 proposed" — the previous version said "8 ADRs, 3 proposed", which was stale). Two notes on ADR-012/013 and pillar 1 are kept (they are specific to the current state and useful before opening a PR).
- **`README.md`**: version 1.1 → **1.2**. The `code` badge is updated to `code-103_tests_green`. The "Project Status" section reflects that L0 is **implemented** (6 crates, 103 tests). The "Deterministic" bullet is annotated with "*(Currently global; under review for local, see ADR-013.)*". The "Determinism" section gains a **"Under review (ADR-013, proposed)"** note. The "Documentation Map" gains a row for `PLUGIN_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`. The "Repository Structure" shows the 6 crates. The FAQ is updated: "**five** remain unresolved" (005, 006, 007, 012, 013), plus a new FAQ entry "What is ADR-012 / ADR-013 about?". The roadmap is updated to "L0 ratified + implemented".

### Why

The two ADRs are **proposed**, not accepted, because the framework does not yet implement the plugin system. The doctrine (`00-foundations`) cannot declare "local determinism" before the code does. The Honesty Rule (`STRUCTURE.md` §11) requires that the docs say the truth: the determinism is global today, and the move to local determinism is **under review**.

When the framework implements the plugin system (steps 11+), ADR-012 and ADR-013 will be ratified, and `00-foundations.md` will be rewritten in the same commit. Until then, the docs say "under review".

## [2026-10-25] — Rename crate prefix `fmr-` → `pcfm-`

### Changed

- **All documentation files**: the crate prefix `fmr-` was renamed to `pcfm-` (e.g. `fmr-core` → `pcfm-core`, `fmr-hidden` → `pcfm-hidden`, `fmr-match` → `pcfm-match`). The historical prefix `fmr-` (from the original "FMR project" name) is deprecated.
- **All documentation files**: the module path prefix `fmr_` was renamed to `pcfm_` (e.g. `fmr_core::rng` → `pcfm_core::rng`).

### Why

The project is called **PC Football Manager** (PCFM). The prefix `pcfm-` matches the project name. The old prefix `fmr-` was a historical abbreviation from the initial "FMR project" naming, never adopted in user-facing material. The rename was done before any code was written, so no `Cargo.toml` or import needs to change. Doing it now costs minutes; doing it after the first line of code costs days.

### What did not change

- The repository name (`pcfootballmanager`) — unchanged.
- The project name (`PC Football Manager`) — unchanged.
- All architectural decisions — unchanged.
- The `LICENSE.md` file — unchanged (it refers to "PC Football Manager" by name, not by crate prefix).

## [2026-10-25] — ADR-008: provider integration is external, not core

### Added

- **`docs/adr/008-provider-integration-external.md`** — accepted. Provider integrations (Wyscout, StatsBomb, Opta, etc.) are **external tools that produce packs**, not core modules. The core does not talk to providers, does not read credentials, does not model rate limits. This keeps the core offline-first, sandboxed, and lightweight.

### Changed

- **`modules/00-foundations.md`**: version 1.1 → **1.2**. Added one sentence to §7 (Non-goals): provider integrations are external tools, not core modules. No invariant changed. Cells do not need to be re-checked.
- **`modules/_index.md`**: version 2.4 → **2.5**. The `L2-ingest` row was reclassified from a core cell to **🔌 external tool**. Added a dedicated section "Provider integrations (external, not core)". ADR status table updated with ADR-008.

### Summary

Before this entry, the specification contained a planned `L2-ingest` cell for Wyscout / StatsBomb / Opta integration. That cell conflicted with three core principles:

- The core is **offline-first** (a core module that talks to the network is not).
- The core is **sandboxed** (a core module that reads credentials is not).
- The core is **lightweight** (provider integration is a large, provider-specific, license-sensitive feature).

After this entry:

- **`L2-ingest` no longer exists as a core cell.**
- **A tool** (team, community, or third party) talks to the provider, produces a pack, and the user installs the pack.
- **The core does not know that Wyscout exists.**

This is consistent with ADR-002 (offline-first), `00-foundations` §5 (no bundled commercial data), and `STRUCTURE.md` §9 (packs extend content, not structure).

### Related ADRs

- ADR-002 — offline-first
- ADR-008 — this decision

## [2026-10-25] — ADR-003 ratified: Plane A enforcement (option B)

### Changed

- **ADR-003** (`docs/adr/003-plane-a-enforcement.md`): status `proposed` → **`accepted`**. Option B (capability API) is now the binding decision. `pcfm-hidden` exposes only `resolve_*` and `drain_observations`; latents never cross the crate boundary.
- **`modules/L0-match/04-match-engine.md`**: version 1.1 → **1.2**, status `draft` → **`ratified`**. The match engine can now be implemented.
- **`modules/L0-match/08-random-events.md`**: version 1.1 → **1.2**, status `draft` → **`ratified`**. The random events cell can now be implemented.
- **`modules/L0-match/10-ground-truth.md`**: version 1.0 → **1.1**, status `draft` → **`ratified`**. The `GroundTruth` API is now the implementation contract.
- **`modules/L0-match/00-overview.md`**: version 1.1 → **1.2**. All 11 cells `ratified`; DoD split into "specification (complete)" and "implementation (pending)".
- **`modules/_index.md`**: version 2.2 → **2.3**. All L0 cells `ratified`. ADR-003 moved from "Open ADRs" to "Accepted". Cross-cell components table updated.
- **`STRUCTURE.md`**: version 1.2 → **1.3**. L0 directory layout shows 11 cells (was 10). ADR-003 status updated in §5. Open ADRs reduced to 005, 006, 007.
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`**: version 1.0 → **1.1**. "Current state" reflects L0 ratified and code-ready. ADR status table shows ADR-003 accepted. "Code (when it exists)" → "Code (now that L0 is ratified)".
- **`README.md`**: version 1.0 → **1.1**. Project status shows L0 at 100% (11 cells, ADR-003 accepted). Badge `status-L0_ratified`. FAQ: "Four remain unresolved" → "Three remain unresolved" (ADR-003 removed). Documentation Map includes GLOSSARY.

### Summary

Before this entry, three L0 cells were `draft` (L0.04, L0.08, L0.10) and blocked by ADR-003. After this entry:

- **All 11 L0 cells are `ratified`.**
- **ADR-003 is `accepted`** (option B: capability API, `GroundTruth` with `resolve_*` only).
- **The L0 specification is complete.**
- **Code can begin**, starting from `pcfm-core`, `pcfm-hidden`, and `pcfm-match` (see `STRUCTURE.md` §3).

The Doctrine was unchanged at that point. `00-foundations` remained at v1.1.

---
## [2026-10-25] — Structure v1.1: glossary, L0.10, L0 cells v1.1

### Added

- **`docs/GLOSSARY.md`** (v1.0) — 30+ terms with definitions and links to the source. Sections: Core, Data model, Determinism, Architecture, Process, Banned, External, Abbreviations, Historical.
- **`modules/L0-match/10-ground-truth.md`** (v1.0, `draft` at the time) — the cell that centralises the public API of `pcfm-hidden`. Before this cell, the API was scattered across L0.03 §3.2, L0.04 §1, L0.05 §2.3 and ADR-003.
- **9 `.gitkeep` files** in `crates/`, `registry/`, `mods/`, `data/`, `docs/legal/`, `docs/calibration/`, `archive/prompts/`, `archive/doctrine/`, `archive/legacy/` — placeholder directories kept in git.

### Changed

- **`modules/_index.md`**: version 2.1 → **2.2** (then → 2.3, see next entry). L0.10 row added. Cross-cell components table added. ADR status table added.
- **`modules/L0-match/00-overview.md`**: version 1.0 → **1.1**. L0.10 added to the cell table and dependency rules. §5 (Three Planes) now points to L0.10 for the `GroundTruth` API.
- **`modules/L0-match/03-entities-minimal.md`**: version 1.0 → **1.1**. §3.2 "Where are the latents?" now points to L0.10 instead of duplicating the API.
- **`modules/L0-match/04-match-engine.md`**: version 1.0 → **1.1**. Depends on L0.10. The `GroundTruth` API is referenced, not duplicated.
- **`modules/L0-match/07-save-minimal.md`**: version 1.0 → **1.1**. Depends on L0.10. §2.6 (GroundTruth reconstruction) points to L0.10 §2.1 for the API contract.
- **`modules/L0-match/08-random-events.md`**: version 1.0 → **1.1**. Depends on L0.10. The `resolve_*` API is referenced, not duplicated.
- **`modules/L0-match/09-context-modifiers.md`**: version 1.0 → **1.1**. §7 References now includes `docs/GLOSSARY.md`.

### Summary

The `pcfm-hidden` API now has a single home (`L0.10`). Before, a reader who wanted to understand "what can `pcfm-hidden` do?" had to read four files. After, they read one. The other L0 cells link to it.

---
## [2026-10-25] — Structure v1.1: concentric model, L0 complete, ADRs

### Added

- **Concentric structure (L0–L3)** in `00-foundations.md` §9 and `STRUCTURE.md` §2.
- **`modules/L0-match/`** — 10 cells: `00-overview`, `01-rng`, `02-event-bus`, `03-entities-minimal`, `04-match-engine`, `05-match-events`, `06-match-output`, `07-save-minimal`, `08-random-events`, `09-context-modifiers`.
- **`docs/adr/`** — 8 ADRs: `000-template`, `001-language-rust`, `002-project-name-and-scope`, `003-plane-a-enforcement`, `004-panic-strategy-ffi`, `005-qt-binding`, `006-license`, `007-canonical-language`.
- **`LICENSE.md`**, `LICENSE-MIT`, `LICENSE-APACHE`, `LICENSE-ASSETS` (proposed, pending ADR-006 ratification).
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** — process, review checklist, ADR workflow, licensing of contributions.
- **`STRUCTURE.md`** — meta-document: layout, frontmatter, ADR process, language policy, level rules.
- **`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`** and `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` (`bug_report.md`, `module-revision.md`).
- **`.gitignore`** — Rust artifacts, profiling, IDE, OS, user data, secrets, pack cache, generated worlds.
- **`CHANGELOG.md`**, `CHANGELOG-SIM.md`, `CHANGELOG-REGISTRY.md`.
- **`docs/MIGRATION-01-04.md`** — migration plan for the four legacy Italian modules.
- **`archive/README.md`** — rules for the archive folder.

### Changed

- **`README.md`** — updated to reflect the concentric structure, the dual license proposal, and the four open ADRs. Removed the flat "modules 5 of 25" badge.
- **`modules/00-foundations.md`** — bumped to `v1.1`, added §9 (Concentric Structure), linked to ADR-003 explicitly.
- **`modules/_index.md`** — bumped to `v2.0`. Rewritten as a concentric map. L1–L3 cells are marked `planned` and their links are not clickable (they do not exist yet).
- **`docs/adr/002-project-name-and-scope.md`** — `Blocks:` no longer mentions `22-roadmap.md` (the flat module no longer exists) or `LICENSE.md` (that is ADR-006's block).

### Removed

- **Flat 25-module structure** (previously implied by `01-architecture.md`, `02-registry.md`, `03-pack-system.md`, `04-data-model.md`). These four files were removed from the repository. Their content is being migrated to the concentric structure; a formal `docs/MIGRATION-01-04.md` tracks the migration. The files were never committed to git and are not recoverable from history; they are recoverable from the initial project conversation.

### Fixed

- **Broken links to `archive/Prompt_Master_v7.md`** in `00-foundations.md`, `L0.00`, `L0.01`, `L0.04`, `L0.05`, `L0.06`, `L0.08`. Now marked `(planned)` in plain text.
- **Broken links to `balance/*.toml`, `crates/*`, `locales/*`, `L1-*`, `L2-*`, `L3-*`** in all L0 cells. Now marked `(planned)` in plain text.
- **Inconsistent `conforms_to` field** — all ratified L0 cells now declare `conforms_to: "00-foundations (v1.1)"`.

---
## [2026-10-24] — Initial documentation drop

### Added

- `README.md` — project overview, AI disclosure, status, technical philosophy.
- `modules/00-foundations.md` — v1.0, the doctrine.
- `modules/01-architecture.md` — Rust workspace, determinism, dependencies.
- `modules/02-registry.md` — modular registry.
- `modules/03-pack-system.md` — local packs.
- `modules/04-data-model.md` — canonical schema.

### Notes

- This drop used a **flat 25-module numbering**. It was superseded the following day by the concentric model.
- `01-architecture.md`, `02-registry.md`, `03-pack-system.md`, `04-data-model.md` were written in Italian. They were never committed to git.

---
<!--
  NOTES FOR FUTURE EDITORS:

  - Keep this file honest. If a release date slips, update the date and say so.
    Do not delete entries.
  - One entry per logical change. A change that touches code and docs goes in
    both this file and CHANGELOG-SIM.md (if it changes simulation behaviour).
  - A SIM_VERSION bump is recorded in CHANGELOG-SIM.md, not here.
  - A registry deprecation is recorded in CHANGELOG-REGISTRY.md, not here.
  - Do not use marketing language. "Refactor", "fix", "remove" are fine.
  - When an ADR is ratified, add an entry with the list of files whose status
    changed as a consequence (this is the L0.04 / L0.08 / L0.10 pattern).
