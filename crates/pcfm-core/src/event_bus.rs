//! Event bus — deterministic, in-process dispatch.
//!
//! See `modules/L0-match/02-event-bus.md` for the full specification.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! - Events are queued and dispatched in **insertion order** (`seq`).
//! - Handlers for the same event kind are called in **registration order**.
//! - The queue is drained on each `dispatch_all`. Events published during
//!   a previous dispatch are not re-processed in the same cycle.
//! - The bus is **single-threaded per match**. Parallelism, when needed, is
//!   at the match level (multiple matches in parallel, each with its own bus),
//!   not within a match.
//!
//! # Limitation (step 2)
//!
//! Handlers do not receive a mutable reference to the bus, and therefore
//! cannot publish new events during dispatch. If a future need requires
//! handlers to publish, the API will be extended (see §4 of the spec).
