//! `pcfm-model` — minimal entities for PCFM.
//!
//! See `modules/L0-match/03-entities-minimal.md` for the full specification.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! This crate contains only the entities required to play a single match.
//! It does **not** contain Club, Competition, Contract, Staff, or any other
//! L1/L2 entity. If the match engine does not need it, it is not here.
//!
//! # Plane separation
//!
//! Every entity in this crate is **Plane B/C data**: it can be serialised,
//! logged, and displayed. Latent attributes (Plane A) do **not** appear in
//! any struct here. They live in `pcfm-hidden`, indexed by `PlayerId`, and
//! are accessed only via `GroundTruth::resolve_*` (see ADR-003 and
//! `modules/L0-match/10-ground-truth.md`).
