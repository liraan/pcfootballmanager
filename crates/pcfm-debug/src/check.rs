//! Health check entry point.
//!
//! Builds a `TestRegistry`, registers all known scenarios (via
//! `features::register_all`), runs them with the given seed, and adapts
//! the resulting `RunReport` into the `CheckReport` shape the CLI expects.
//!
//! The actual test logic lives in `features/l0_match.rs` (and, in the
//! future, `features/l1_*`, `features/l2_*`, `features/l3_*`, plugins).
//! This file only knows how to run a registry and format the report.
