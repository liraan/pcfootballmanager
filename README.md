## Why this project exists

Football Manager and its ancestors built a genre. They also built walls around it: closed datasets, closed formulas, closed ecosystems. PC Football Manager is an attempt to rebuild that experience **without the walls**.

- ❌ No telemetry. Nothing leaves your machine.
- ❌ No proprietary data feeds. Open, procedural, and community packs only.
- ❌ No hidden `CA/PA` scalars pretending to be truth.
- ✅ Every formula is public.
- ✅ Every decision is documented in an ADR.
- ✅ Every save is reproducible from its seed.

> **This is not a Football Manager clone.** It's a different philosophy, applied to the same genre. Where FM optimizes for fidelity to licensed data, we optimize for **explainability and ownership**.

---

## The core idea: Three Planes

The single most important architectural choice in PCFM is the strict separation of *what the simulation knows*, *what the game shows*, and *what people believe*. Collapsing these layers is what turns scouting into a lookup table — the thing every modern management sim accidentally does.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  PLANE A — Ground Truth                     (hidden)    │
│  True attributes, real fatigue, latent psyche.          │
│  Readable only by the match engine and the world gen.   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  PLANE B — Observation                      (events)    │
│  MatchEvents: shots, passes, duels.                     │
│  Ratings computed from events, never from latents.      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  PLANE C — Estimation                       (visible)   │
│  Windowed indexes, projection bands, scout reports.     │
│  Never feeds back into Plane A.                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why it matters:** scouting in PCFM is not a lookup — it's an *estimate of an observation of the truth*. The player is meant to be uncertain. That uncertainty is the game.

## Determinism, taken seriously

Same seed → same match, same season, same career. **Always.** This is verified on every CI run by `pcfm-debug --check`:

```
  ✅ demo teams are valid
  ✅ same seed → same state_hash
  ✅ different seed → different state_hash
  ✅ save/load roundtrip preserves state_hash
  ✅ event chain is valid
  ✅ statistics are sane
```

The rules that make this possible are non-negotiable:

- Named RNG streams, so adding a new consumer never shifts existing results
- `BTreeMap` (never `HashMap`) in any simulation path
- Fixed-point arithmetic for money — zero numerical drift
- Golden hash tests on every simulation change
- `SIM_VERSION` bump procedure documented in [`CHANGELOG-SIM.md`](CHANGELOG-SIM.md)

> **A note on scope:** determinism today is **global** — same seed across all configurations. [ADR-013](docs/adr/013-worlds.md) proposes making it **local** (per save, per module). It is *proposed, not ratified*. Until it is, the doctrine stands as written.

## Project status

<div align="center">

| Level | Specification | Code |
|:-----:|:-------------:|:----:|
| **L0** — Match   | 🟢 11 cells, ratified | 🟢 6 crates, 103 tests, 6 test scenarios |
| **L1** — Season  | ⚪ 12 cells planned   | ⚪ not started |
| **L2** — Career  | ⚪ 9 cells planned    | ⚪ not started |
| **L3** — Meta    | ⚪ 8 cells planned    | ⚪ not started |

</div>

**Where we are:** L0 is **complete, ratified, implemented, and tested**. The framework compiles, the health check is green, the determinism contract is enforced, and the test harness (`pcfm-testkit`) is in place. L1 (the season) is the next specification milestone. **No playable build exists yet** — the docs have to be solid before the engine is.

**Roadmap (indicative, not commitments):**

| Phase | Target |
|-------|--------|
| Prototype | Q1 2027 |
| Alpha (closed) | Q3 2027 |
| Beta | Q1 2028 |
| v1.0 | Q2 2028 |

## What makes it different

| | Traditional FM | **PC Football Manager** |
|---|---|---|
| **Potential** | Secret scalar (`CA/PA`) | Transparent confidence band |
| **Attributes** | True = displayed | True ≠ displayed; displayed is an estimate |
| **Scouting** | Accurate reports | Reports with **declared bias** |
| **Telemetry** | Optional | Does not exist |
| **Data** | Proprietary (Wyscout, Opta) | Open + procedural + community |
| **Modding** | Limited tooling | Modular registry, local packs |
| **Determinism** | Partial | **Total**, verified by golden tests |
| **Privacy** | Online-adjacent | Offline-first |

---

## Technology

| Layer | Choice | Why |
|-------|--------|-----|
| Language | **Rust 1.85+** | Type safety, zero-cost abstractions, guaranteed determinism |
| Numerics | `fixed`, `libm` | Fixed-point money; portable transcendentals |
| UI | `cxx-qt` + QWidgets + QML | Only binding covering data grids *and* skins → [ADR-005](docs/adr/005-qt-binding.md) |
| Testing | `proptest`, `criterion`, Miri, ASan, **`pcfm-testkit`** | Property-based, benchmarks, UB detection, extensible coretest |
| Audit | `cargo-deny` | Dependency hygiene |

Dependencies are pinned and justified in ADRs. No `*` versions in `Cargo.toml`. Every upgrade goes through a deliberate process.

## Getting started

Requires **Rust 1.85+ (stable)**.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/liraan/pcfootballmanager.git
cd pcfootballmanager
cargo build --release
cargo run --release --bin pcfm-debug -- --check --seed 42
```

If `--check` prints `6/6 checks passed`, the framework is healthy. If it doesn't, something in the simulation contract is broken — please [open an issue](https://github.com/liraan/pcfootballmanager/issues).

**Inspect the test harness:**

```bash
# List the registered test scenarios
cargo run --release --bin pcfm-debug -- --list

# Show which features have at least one scenario, and which do not
cargo run --release --bin pcfm-debug -- --coverage
```

`--coverage` is the map of what the framework can do today. At the moment it shows `2/26 features covered (7%)` — L0 is complete, L1–L3 are still empty. When a module is implemented and its scenarios are registered, the percentage goes up.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome — code, docs, data, bug reports, honest criticism.

**The short version:**
- One change per PR (one module, one ADR, one fix).
- English is canonical for code, commits, and technical docs → [ADR-007](docs/adr/007-canonical-language.md).
- Every factual claim needs a source. Every decision needs an ADR if it changes an invariant.
- Every contribution is **reviewed by a human**. AI may draft; humans decide.
- Determinism is not negotiable: PRs that break the seed → hash invariant require an ADR.

**Contributing tests to the coretest:**
- Implement `pcfm_testkit::Scenario` for your feature.
- Register it in `pcfm-debug/src/features/register_all` (or a plugin-specific registration function).
- Run `--coverage` and confirm your feature shows `[✅]`.
- See [`docs/PLUGIN_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`](docs/PLUGIN_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md) §"Contributing test scenarios" for the full walkthrough.

## AI disclosure

Some documentation and code in this repo was **drafted with AI**, then **reviewed, corrected, and owned by a human**. We say this openly because transparency applies to our own process too.

| Reality | What it means |
|---------|---------------|
| **AI drafts, humans decide** | Every architectural decision — the Three Planes, the ban on CA/PA, the determinism rules — was made by a person. |
| **AI makes mistakes** | Caught in review: a non-existent crate dependency, a hasher that would have broken determinism, a contradictory panic strategy at the FFI boundary. **Verify before you rely.** |
| **AI has no memory** | Each session starts blank. **This repository is the memory.** |
| **No unreviewed AI code** | There is no unreviewed AI-written code in this repo. Every line has a human owner. |

## FAQ

**Is this a Football Manager clone?**
No. It's an alternative with a different philosophy. FM is proprietary, uses closed datasets, and ships telemetry. PCFM is community-driven, transparent, offline-first.

**Will you use Wyscout / Opta data?**
No. Bundling licensed datasets is ruled out by design. Provider integration is an *external tool* that produces packs, not a core module → [ADR-008](docs/adr/008-provider-integration-external.md). Open data, procedural data, and community packs (with clear provenance) only.

**Can I contribute without knowing how to program?**
Yes. The documentation needs feedback, corrections, and additions. If you understand football or game design, your input matters.

**When is the alpha?**
When L0 and L1 are stable and a minimal kernel runs. Indicatively **Q1 2027**. No promises.

**Which decisions are actually settled?**
Settled: the doctrine, the Three Planes, Plane A enforcement (ADR-003), FFI panic strategy (ADR-004), Qt binding (ADR-005), license (ADR-006), canonical language (ADR-007), provider integration policy (ADR-008).
Still open: module system ([ADR-012](docs/adr/012-plugins.md)), world system ([ADR-013](docs/adr/013-worlds.md)), v1.0 scope ([ADR-015](docs/adr/015-v1-scope.md)).

**What is `pcfm-testkit`?**
A small crate that defines the `Scenario` trait and the `TestRegistry`. It has **no dependency on any other `pcfm-*` crate**, so core modules, plugins, and tools can all contribute test scenarios without coupling. `pcfm-debug --check` runs them; `--list` and `--coverage` inspect them.

**How much was written by AI?**
See [AI disclosure](#-ai-disclosure). Short version: drafted by AI, reviewed by a human. Every technical claim should be verified before you depend on it.
