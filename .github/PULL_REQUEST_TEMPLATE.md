Thank you for contributing. Before submitting, please fill in the sections below.

## What does this PR do?

<!--
  One or two sentences. What changes, and why?

  Examples:
  - "Adds L1-season/00-overview.md (first cell of L1)."
  - "Fixes a broken link in specs/L0-match/07-save-minimal.md."
  - "Proposes ADR-008 on the calendar model."
-->



## Type of change

<!-- Check one. -->

- [ ] **New cell** (one module file, with frontmatter)
- [ ] **Revised cell** (version bump in the frontmatter, minor or major)
- [ ] **New ADR** (proposes a decision, `status: proposed`)
- [ ] **ADR ratification** (`status: proposed` → `status: accepted`)
- [ ] **Fix** (typo, broken link, factual correction — no semantic change)
- [ ] **Structure change** (README, STRUCTURE, CONTRIBUTING, CHANGELOG)
- [ ] **Other** (explain below)

If "Other", describe:



## Scope check

<!--
  One PR = one change. If this PR touches more than one of the following,
  split it. See CONTRIBUTING.md.
-->

- [ ] This PR touches **one cell** (or one ADR, or one fix).
- [ ] I have **not** bundled unrelated changes.
- [ ] If this PR touches an open ADR (003, 005, 006, 007), I have checked that the ADR is accepted, or this PR **is** the ADR ratification.

## Doctrine compliance

<!--
  The non-negotiable rules from specs/00-foundations.md.
  Tick every box. If a box cannot be ticked, explain in "Doctrine exceptions".
-->

- [ ] **No CA/PA.** No `current_ability`, `potential_ability`, or equivalent scalar introduced.
- [ ] **No truth leakage.** No module outside `pcfm-hidden` and `pcfm-match` (or `pcfm-gen`) reads Plane A.
- [ ] **No ratings from latents.** Any rating formula introduced takes `&[MatchEvent]`, not latent fields.
- [ ] **No Plane C → Plane A feedback.**
- [ ] **No hardcoded rules, names, colours, or balance values.** Everything lives in files.
- [ ] **No invented real data.**
- [ ] **No commercial data, no scraping.**
- [ ] **No unlicensed assets.**
- [ ] **Determinism preserved.** Named RNG streams, no `HashMap` in simulation paths, no `f32` in the critical path.
- [ ] **No entities deleted from the registry.** Deprecated, never deleted.
- [ ] **No save-breaking change without a migration.**
- [ ] **No circular dependency between modules.**
- [ ] **Statistics are append-only.**
- [ ] **Confidence intervals are not hidden.**

### Doctrine exceptions

<!--
  If any box above is not ticked, explain why here. A doctrine exception
  requires a doctrine ADR. Do not merge without one.
-->



---

## Level compliance

<!--
  The specification is concentric (L0 → L1 → L2 → L3).
  A level N cell may read the OUTPUT of a level < N cell, never its internals.
  A level N cell may NOT depend on a level > N cell.
  See STRUCTURE.md §2.
-->

- [ ] If this PR adds a cell, the cell is at the **correct level** (L0, L1, L2, or L3).
- [ ] If this PR adds a cell, its `depends_on` only lists cells at the **same level or below**.
- [ ] If this PR adds a cell, its `referenced_by` is updated in downstream cells.
- [ ] If this PR adds a cell, `specs/_index.md` is updated.

If any box cannot be ticked, explain:

## Frontmatter (for new or revised cells)

<!--
  Every cell has a frontmatter. See STRUCTURE.md §4.
  Fill in the values for the cell this PR adds or revises.
-->

```yaml
---
title: "L{level}.{NN} — {title}"
level: {0|1|2|3}
cell: "L{level}-{name}"
module_id: "L{level}.{NN}"
version: "{x.y}"
status: "{draft|review|ratified}"
last_updated: "YYYY-MM-DD"
supersedes: {null | "previous-id"}
depends_on: [...]
referenced_by: [...]
conforms_to: "00-foundations (v1.1)"
---
```

---

## Sources

<!--
  Every factual claim needs a source. If you can't find one, say "unverified".
  Do not invent. See CONTRIBUTING.md.
-->

- [ ] I have cited sources for every factual claim.
- [ ] If a claim is unverified, I have said so explicitly.

## Review checklist (for the reviewer)

<!--
  The reviewer ticks these, not the author.
-->

- [ ] Frontmatter is present and correct.
- [ ] Doctrine is not contradicted (or a doctrine ADR is linked).
- [ ] Level dependency rules are not violated.
- [ ] Sources are cited for factual claims.
- [ ] The WHY is explained, not just the what.
- [ ] One change per PR.
- [ ] If the PR touches an open ADR, the ADR is accepted first (or this PR is the ratification).
- [ ] `specs/_index.md` is updated if a cell was added.
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` has an entry if the change is user-visible.
- [ ] No contradiction with existing cells.
- [ ] Language is English (or a translation in `locales/`).
- [ ] No `License: Proprietary` string anywhere.
- [ ] No `TBD` left in a field that should have a value.

## Notes for the reviewer

<!--
  Anything the reviewer should know: a tricky decision, a known limitation,
  a question you want to discuss before merge.

<!--
  Thank you. If this PR is small and clear, it will be merged quickly.
  If it is large and unclear, it will be sent back. That is by design.
