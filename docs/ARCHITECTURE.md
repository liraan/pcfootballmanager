# Architecture — PCFM

**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** active
**Last updated:** 2026-10-26

This document explains how the seven crates of PCFM interact, how a match
flows through the system, and what the two architectural patterns
(simulation/rendering split, testkit contract) are. It is the
**architectural** counterpart of [`STRUCTURE.md`](../STRUCTURE.md), which
describes the *rules of the repository*.

It is the document that was missing: a newcomer could read the doctrine
(`modules/00-foundations.md`) and the code (52 files), but not how they
fit together.

## 1. The seven crates

| Crate | Role | Plane | Depends on |
|-------|------|-------|------------|
| `pcfm-core` | Infrastructure: RNG, event bus, IDs, hash, time | — | (none) |
| `pcfm-model` | Minimal entities: Player (no latents), Squad, Pitch, Referee, Match, CauseTrace | B/C | `pcfm-core` |
| `pcfm-hidden` | Plane A: GroundTruth, `resolve_*`, `drain_observations` | **A** | `pcfm-core`, `pcfm-model` |
| `pcfm-stats` | Plane B: MatchEvent, EventChain (append-only, hash chain) | B | `pcfm-core`, `pcfm-model` |
| `pcfm-match` | Match engine: orchestrator `simulate_match`, `TextMatchEngine`, save/load, narrative | — | `pcfm-core`, `pcfm-model`, `pcfm-hidden`, `pcfm-stats` |
| `pcfm-testkit` | Contract: `Scenario`, `Feature`, `TestRegistry` | — | (none) |
| `pcfm-debug` | CLI: `--check`, `--list`, `--coverage`, `--json`, `--html`, demo teams, rendering | — | all of the above |

**Dependency rule:** every crate depends only on crates at a level **lower
or equal** in the list above. No cycles. `pcfm-testkit` is intentionally
free of `pcfm-*` dependencies: it is the contract that anyone (core,
plugin, tool) implements.

The crate-level dependency graph:

```
pcfm-debug
├── pcfm-core
├── pcfm-model
├── pcfm-hidden
├── pcfm-stats
├── pcfm-match
└── pcfm-testkit

pcfm-match
├── pcfm-core
├── pcfm-model
├── pcfm-hidden
└── pcfm-stats

pcfm-hidden        pcfm-stats
├── pcfm-core      ├── pcfm-core
└── pcfm-model     └── pcfm-model

pcfm-model
└── pcfm-core

pcfm-core          pcfm-testkit
(none)             (none)
```

## 2. The Three Planes, in code

The doctrine (`modules/00-foundations.md` §3) defines three planes. In the
code, they are three distinct things:

| Plane | In code | Serialisable? | Who reads it |
|-------|---------|---------------|--------------|
| **A — Ground Truth** | `GroundTruth` in `pcfm-hidden` | ❌ No | Only `pcfm-match` (via `resolve_*`) and `pcfm-debug` (via `demo_match`) |
| **B — Observation** | `MatchEvent` + `EventChain` in `pcfm-stats` | ✅ Yes | `pcfm-match` (write), `pcfm-debug` (read), future L1/L2 |
| **C — Estimation** | **Not yet implemented** (L2) | — | — |

The boundary is enforced by the compiler, not by review:
- `GroundTruth` has no public fields, is not `Serialize`, has a custom
  `Debug` that prints only `world_seed` and `match_id`.
- `pcfm-stats` does not depend on `pcfm-hidden`. It cannot, even
  accidentally: there is no `use pcfm_hidden::*` anywhere in the crate.

The **only** crate that talks to both planes is `pcfm-match`. It calls
`resolve_*` on Plane A, receives outcomes, and emits `MatchEvent`s to
Plane B. It never sees a latent value.

See [ADR-003](../docs/adr/003-plane-a-enforcement.md) for the full
rationale.

## 3. The flow of a match

A single match goes through the system in 10 steps. This is the sequence
that `pcfm-debug` follows, and the sequence that a future UI will follow.

```
1. demo_match(seed) -> Match           (pcfm-debug::demo)
2. GroundTruth::new(world_seed, id)    (pcfm-hidden)         [Plane A]
3. RngRegistry::new(world_seed)        (pcfm-core)
4. EventChain::new()                   (pcfm-stats)          [Plane B, empty]
5. MatchContext { match_, hidden, rng, chain, config }
6. simulate_match(&mut ctx)            (pcfm-match::orchestrator)
     for each tick:
       a. MatchState::tick(tick, ctx)  (pcfm-match::state)
       b. pick_players(ctx)            (deterministic, from RNG)
       c. action kind roll             (pass / shot / duel / foul)
       d. ctx.hidden.resolve_*(...)    (pcfm-hidden)         [Plane A read]
       e. emit MatchEvent to ctx.chain (pcfm-stats)          [Plane B write]
7. MatchState::finish(chain) -> MatchResult
8. TextMatchEngine::simulate calls narrate() to fill narrative
9. MatchSave::from_result(result, match_, ...)               [no GroundTruth]
10. MatchSave::to_bytes() / from_bytes()                      [JSON, for now]
```

**Two-phase events:** step 6e emits temporal events in two synchronous phases (ADR-019 D11): an *attempt* event carrying a `PositionSnapshot`, followed by the *outcome* event linked back via `attempt_event_id`. Both phases occur in the same tick. See [`modules/L0-match/05-match-events.md`](../modules/L0-match/05-match-events.md) §2.6.

**Key invariant:** step 6d is the only interaction with Plane A. The
engine constructs a `DuelContext`/`ShotContext`/etc., calls `resolve_*`,
receives a `DuelOutcome`/`ShotOutcome`/etc., and turns it into a
`MatchEvent`. It never reads a latent.

**Key invariant:** the `MatchSave` does not contain `GroundTruth`. On
load, `GroundTruth::new(world_seed, match_id)` reconstructs it, and
`replay()` re-runs `simulate_match`. The chain hash verifies that the
replayed events match the saved ones.

---

## 4. The simulation/rendering split

The most important pattern in the codebase:

- **`simulate_match`** (in `pcfm-match::orchestrator`) is the **only**
  implementation of the tick loop and micro-decisions. It returns a
  `MatchResult` with an **empty** `narrative` field.
- **`TextMatchEngine`** (in `pcfm-match::engine`) is a thin wrapper:
  it calls `simulate_match`, then calls `narrate()` to fill the
  narrative, then returns the result.
- **A future `ThreeDEngine`** (e.g. `pcfm-match-3d`) will be a **new
  crate** that calls the **same** `simulate_match`, then renders the
  result to 3D. It does not touch `pcfm-match`.

The test `simulation_is_shared_and_renderer_agnostic` in `engine.rs`
verifies that two calls to `simulate_match` with the same seed produce
identical `score`, `stats`, `state_hash`, and `events`. Any renderer
that calls `simulate_match` will get the same data.

**Why this matters:** the project will eventually have a 3D renderer.
Without this split, adding 3D would require duplicating or modifying the
simulation. With it, the 3D renderer is additive.

See `docs/PLUGIN_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` §3 for the developer-facing view.

## 5. The testkit contract

`pcfm-testkit` is a **contract crate**: it defines `Scenario`,
`Feature`, and `TestRegistry`, and depends on **no other `pcfm-*`
crate**. This is deliberate.

- A **core module** (`features/l0_match.rs` in `pcfm-debug`) implements
  `Scenario` and registers itself in `register_all`.
- A **plugin** can implement `Scenario` in its own crate, register
  itself via a public `register_tests(registry)` function, and be
  discovered by `pcfm-debug` (mechanism TBD, see ADR-012).
- A **tool** (e.g. `pcfm-verify`) can do the same.

`pcfm-debug --check` builds a `TestRegistry`, calls `register_all`, runs
`run_all(seed)`, and aggregates the results. `--list` and `--coverage`
inspect the registry without running it.

**Why a separate crate:** if `pcfm-testkit` depended on `pcfm-match`,
plugins would have to depend on `pcfm-match` to implement `Scenario`,
and the contract would collapse. Keeping it dependency-free means the
contract is usable by anyone, in any direction.

See `docs/PLUGIN_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` §11 for how to contribute a
scenario.

## 6. What is not yet implemented

| Component | Status | Where it will live |
|-----------|--------|---------------------|
| L1 (season, world, roster) | Planned | `modules/L1-*/`, `crates/pcfm-l1-*/` |
| L2 (career, market, psyche, …) | Planned | `modules/L2-*/`, `crates/pcfm-l2-*/` |
| L3 (registry, packs, editor, UI, …) | Planned | `modules/L3-*/`, `crates/pcfm-l3-*/` |
| Plugin system (ADR-012) | Accepted, not implemented | `pcfm-gen`, `pcfm-match-3d`, etc. |
| World system (ADR-013) | Accepted, not implemented | Save format, LOD, manifest |
| 3D match engine | Planned | `crates/pcfm-match-3d/` |
| Qt UI | Planned | `crates/pcfm-bridge/`, `crates/pcfm-ui/` |
| Deterministic sim model (realistic xG, duels, …) | Prototype | `pcfm-hidden::resolve_*` |

The current simulation (`pcfm-hidden::resolve_*`) is a **prototype**.
It is deterministic and it satisfies the contracts, but it is not a
realistic football model. See the module docs for the current
simplifications.
