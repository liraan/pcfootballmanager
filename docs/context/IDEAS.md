# Ideas — PCFM

**Purpose:** a curated backlog of ideas that are not yet decisions. Unlike `PROJECT-IDEA-LOG.md` (archived historical record), this file holds ideas in motion: sketches, open questions, trade-offs.

**Admission rule:** an idea enters only if (a) it has been discussed, (b) it is not already decided or placed elsewhere (ADR, module, `WORLD-MODEL.md`), (c) it is worth tracking. Rejected ideas are kept in a separate section, with motivation, to avoid re-discussing them.

**Promotion rule:** when an idea becomes a decision, mark it `promoted → ADR-NNN` (or `promoted → module`) and keep it here for traceability. Do not delete.

**Categories:** Player model, Match engine, Career (L2), World, UX / Presentation, Infrastructure.

## Open ideas

### IDEA-PM-001 — Dynamic attributes over a season
- **Status:** sketch
- **Category:** Player model (L2 career)
- **Source:** conversation 2026-10-27 (user)
- **Idea:** attributes evolve over a season: physical decline with age, technical improvement possible, confidence modulates match performance (over/under-performance).
- **Open questions:** age curves; training and game-time effect; confidence source (wins? form? role?); determinism (Plane A vs B); interaction with ADR-016 psyche axes.
- **Critical note:** "losing improves technique" is a weak heuristic — it can create a perverse incentive (losing is good). Better: the loss is the context, professionalism (an ADR-016 axis) is the mechanism. Without professionalism, losing teaches nothing.

### IDEA-PM-002 — Multi-attribute success range per action
- **Status:** sketch
- **Category:** Player model (match resolution)
- **Source:** conversation 2026-10-27 (user, proposal 2)
- **Idea:** every action (shot, pass, duel) is resolved by a *combination* of attributes — technical, physical, psychological — that together define a **success range**. Example: a shot depends on shooting, composure, finishing, stamina, balance, concentration, aggression, teamwork. No single attribute decides the outcome.
- **Open questions:** the formula (weighted sum? thresholds? probability distribution?); which attributes per action; how the range is computed deterministically (integers / fixed-point); how it interacts with the zone of influence (ADR-019 D8) and with the two-phase events (D11).
- **Critical note:** the formula is deferred to `docs/calibration/`. Without calibration, the weights are arbitrary. The principle (multi-attribute, not single-attribute) is the decision; the numbers are not.

### IDEA-PM-003 — Confidence as a psychological axis or modulator
- **Status:** sketch
- **Category:** Player model (L2 psyche)
- **Source:** conversation 2026-10-27 (user)
- **Idea:** ADR-016 has three active axes (professionalism, ambition, pressure). "Confidence" (fiducia) is not one of them. It could be a fourth axis, or a modulator that depends on form/wins and affects performance.
- **Open questions:** is confidence a stable axis (like professionalism) or a dynamic state (like form)? How does it interact with pressure? Does it belong to ADR-016 (content) or to the match engine (parameter)?
- **Critical note:** ADR-016 fixed three axes as a binding decision. Adding a fourth requires an amendment (or a new ADR). Do not treat this as a minor addition.

### IDEA-PM-004 — Concentration as a consumable cognitive resource
- **Status:** sketch (deferred — depends on prerequisites not yet in place)
- **Category:** Player model (L2 psyche) / match engine (L0 consumption)
- **Source:** conversation 2026-10-28 (user)
- **Idea:** a player has a **concentration** resource that is consumed during
  a match. An action that is not instinctive (a function not fully learned)
  costs more concentration, and more physical fatigue. Familiarity with a
  function changes the player's effective attributes; a function not fully
  learned forces the player to "think" each action instead of executing it
  instinctively.
- **Relationship with existing decisions:**
  - **Not pressure.** ADR-016 D1 defines `pressure` as the axis that drives
    performance in high-stakes matches. Concentration, as described here,
    is a *consumable resource*, not a stable trait. The observable effect
    must be **distinct** from pressure (e.g. choice errors, lost time,
    positional mistakes), otherwise pillar 5 (radical transparency) is
    violated: "he underperformed" could not be attributed to pressure or
    to concentration. This is the same reason `consistency` was rejected
    in ADR-016 D1.
  - **ADR-016 is binding.** It fixes three active axes
    (professionalism, ambition, pressure) and three inactive
    (loyalty, consistency, temperament, with `active: false`).
    Concentration is not in the six candidates: adding it as a seventh
    axis, or replacing one, requires an amendment or a new ADR.
  - **Not confidence.** `IDEA-PM-003` covers *confidence* (a modulator
    driven by form and wins). Concentration is a different concept:
    a resource consumed by cognitive load. Do not merge the two.
- **Prerequisites (why this is deferred):**
  1. **Dynamic physical fatigue in L0.** The idea says concentration is
     consumed *together with* physical fatigue. If L0 has no fatigue that
     decays during the tick, concentration would be the second floor of
     a house without the first. Verify whether `PhysicalStateMinimal`
     decays during a match or is static.
  2. **ADR-017 ratified** (roles are labels, not modifiers). The idea
     "positioning changes functions, not attributes" rests on it; today
     ADR-017 is `proposed`.
  3. **Attribute taxonomy (L2-psyche)**: a written list of attributes,
     each classified across the Three Planes (latent / observable / event),
     each with a distinct observable effect. Concentration is one entry in
     that taxonomy, not an isolated addition.
  4. **L0 vs L2 decided.** L2 defines *what* concentration is (an
     attribute, with familiarity and learning). L0 defines *how* it is
     consumed during a match. These are two ADRs, in that order. L0
     consumption requires an L0 hook that does not exist today.
- **Open questions:**
  1. Is concentration a **latent** (Plane A, via `resolve_*`), an
     **observable** (Plane C, via `IndexSnapshot`/`ProjectionProfile`),
     or an **event** ("lost concentration at minute X")? The three have
     different contracts.
  2. Does it share a pool with physical fatigue, or is it a separate pool?
     If they interact, how?
  3. Is the consumption deterministic and reproducible from the seed?
     (It must be: `MatchState::tick` is in the simulation path.)
  4. Does "familiarity with a function" grow over time (L1/L2 learning),
     or is it static per player? If it grows, it is not an L0 concern.
- **Critical note:** touching `MatchState::tick` or `resolve_*` requires a
  `SIM_VERSION` bump (see `CHANGELOG-SIM.md`) and a performance
  measurement, which today does not exist (`PROJECT-STATUS.md`:
  "Not yet measured"). Do not implement before the prerequisites above.

### IDEA-PM-005 — Player footedness (strong foot / weak foot)
- **Status:** sketch
- **Category:** Player model (attributes) / Match engine (L0 action modifier)
- **Source:** conversation 2026-10-29 (user)
- **Idea:** each player has a footedness: a preferred (strong) foot and a
  weak foot. Footedness modifies the quality/cost of actions resolved with
  the weak foot (first touch, pass, shot) and can influence trajectory
  preferences (e.g. a winger cutting inside to shoot with the strong foot).
  Real-world datasets model this simply (preferred_foot: left/right/both);
  FM-style games use two separate ratings, one per foot.
- **Three Planes (proposal, not decided):** footedness would likely live in
  Plane A as a stable identity trait, and be highly observable (Plane B/C):
  unlike hidden traits, estimation error is low. A candidate test case for
  the observation doctrine, subject to ADR.
- **Open questions:**
  1. Model shape: two separate per-foot ratings (FM-style) vs a single
     categorical field (left/right/both) plus one weak-foot rating — the
     latter is more aligned with the minimalist philosophy of PCFM.
  2. Which L0 actions read footedness (first touch, pass, shot, dribble
     direction?) and how it modifies them: action cost, success range (see
     IDEA-PM-002), or both.
  3. Is "both" a real value (ambidextrous players) or just the top of a
     weak-foot scale?
- **Critical note:** L0 is complete and ratified; adding footedness is a
  contract change — it requires a new module or a revision, and an ADR if it
  touches the match engine contract (ADR-019). Do not implement from this
  sketch.

### IDEA-RULE-001 — Contract for rule modules
- **Status:** discussing
- **Category:** Match engine (L0 rules)
- **Source:** conversation 2026-10-27 (ADR-019 discussion)
- **Idea:** refereeing rules (offside, fouls, cards) are behaviour, extensible by modules (ADR-012). The core provides primitives (positions, ball state, temporal events); rule modules read them and produce outcomes. The contract for rule modules is deferred to a dedicated ADR.
- **Open questions:** what a rule module may change (thresholds? priorities? the state machine?); how rule modules interact (conflicts, priority); how they are recorded in the save manifest (ADR-013); performance cost of per-event rule evaluation.
- **Critical note:** "behaviour open" must not become "anything goes": a rule module that rewrites the engine would violate ADR-012. The contract must define what is open and what is closed.

### IDEA-INFRA-001 — Session-start tooling
- **Status:** sketch
- **Category:** Infrastructure (process)
- **Source:** conversation 2026-10-27 (user)
- **Idea:** a small script (or `make` target) that prints `SESSION-STATE.md` + `git log --oneline -5` + `git status --short` in a single block, to paste at the start of a new session. Reduces the number of manual commands.
- **Open questions:** script language (Bash, no Python); where it lives (`tools/`); whether it is versioned; how it handles encoding on Windows (Git Bash).
- **Critical note:** the script is convenience, not a replacement for the checkpoint rule. The bookmark must be updated regardless.

### IDEA-INFRA-002 — Agent tooling for Git
- **Status:** discussing
- **Category:** Infrastructure (agent)
- **Source:** conversation 2026-10-27 (user)
- **Idea:** options for giving an agent (Warp, DeepSeek-TUI) controlled access to Git: MCP server (e.g. `mcp-server-git`), `gh` CLI wrapper, or DeepSeek-TUI with a write token. Phase 2 of `AGENT-POLICY.md`.
- **Open questions:** which option is mature enough; how to enforce the policy (branch, PR, no force-push) at the tool level; token scope and revocation; interaction with the ruleset on `main`.
- **Critical note:** no agent gets a write token until the ruleset on `main` is reactivated. The policy is already written (`AGENT-POLICY.md` §2–§4).

### IDEA-INFRA-004 — `pcfm-test-runner` covers installed modules and plugins
- **Status:** discussing
- **Category:** Infrastructure (testing / tooling)
- **Source:** conversation 2026-10-27 (user, next-session goal)
- **Idea:** extend `pcfm-test-runner` so that `--check` / `--list` / `--coverage`
  also account for scenarios and features contributed by installed modules
  and plugins, not only the 6 built-in L0 scenarios.
- **What exists today (verified in code, 2026-10-27):**
  - `pcfm-testkit::Feature` is `#[non_exhaustive]` and already has a
    `Plugin(String)` variant alongside the 26 built-in features
    (`crates/pcfm-testkit/src/feature.rs:13,87,118`).
  - `TestRegistry::register()` accepts any `impl Scenario`
    (`crates/pcfm-testkit/src/registry.rs:26`); the contract is open.
  - `pcfm-test-runner` hardcodes the discovery path: `check.rs:47-49`,
    `commands.rs:16-17`, `commands.rs:49-50` all call
    `features::register_all(&mut registry)`, and `features/mod.rs:15`
    documents that this is "the only entry point the rest of the binary
    uses".
  - `--coverage` denominator is `Feature::all_builtin()` only
    (`commands.rs:54`); `Plugin(_)` features are never counted.
- **What is missing (the actual gap):**
  1. A discovery step for installed plugin scenarios ("what is installed?").
  2. A way to feed them into the same `TestRegistry` that `pcfm-test-runner` builds.
  3. A report format that distinguishes built-in from plugin scenarios
     (`Feature::Plugin(_)` exists but is not surfaced).
  4. A decision on the coverage denominator: built-in only, or union.
- **Ambiguity to resolve before designing:** "cover installed plugins" can
  mean (a) run plugin-contributed test scenarios alongside L0's, or (b)
  verify that a plugin is loaded and functional (smoke test of the plugin
  system itself). They are different features. Pick one.
- **Constraints from existing decisions:**
  - ADR-012 §1: the plugin sheet is mandatory and validated. Discovery
    should read the sheet, not scan arbitrary directories.
  - ADR-013 §3: the manifest is part of the save and validated. The save is
    a natural discovery source, but only for an in-progress save; a fresh
    workspace has none.
  - "`pcfm-testkit` has no `pcfm-*` dependencies" (codebase rule). Any
    metadata type added to the testkit must respect this. `Feature::Plugin(String)`
    is already a minimal representation that does.
  - The plugin system itself is not implemented yet (no loader, no
    `pcfm-pack`). This idea can be **designed** now but **implemented** only
    after ADR-012's runtime contract exists.
- **Open questions:**
  1. Discovery: `sheet.toml` scan, save manifest, or explicit list passed to
     `pcfm-test-runner`? Each has different determinism and UX implications.
  2. Aggregation in the report: per-plugin rows, per-feature rows, or both?
     What is the stable machine-readable format?
  3. Coverage denominator: built-in only, union, or two separate lines?
  4. Does `Feature::Plugin(String)` suffice, or does the testkit need a
     plugin metadata struct (name + version + feature)?
  5. Does `--check` fail (non-zero exit) when a plugin scenario fails, or
     does it warn?
- **Critical note:** before designing, read (a) the 6 scenarios in
  `crates/pcfm-test-runner/src/features/l0_match.rs` to see what a good `Scenario`
  looks like, (b) `docs/adr/012-plugins.md` §1–§3 for the sheet contract,
  (c) `docs/adr/013-worlds.md` §3 for the manifest. A stale
  snapshot is not sufficient.

### IDEA-INFRA-005 — Separate diagnostics and benchmark from the test runner
- **Status:** discussing
- **Category:** Infrastructure (tooling / observability)
- **Source:** conversation 2026-10-28 (user)
- **Idea:** the test runner (`pcfm-test-runner`, `--check`, `--list`,
  `--coverage`, `--seed`) is now correctly named after ADR-020. Originally
  the crate was `pcfm-debug`, whose name suggested a debugger. Remaining
  scope after ADR-020 — two distinct directions:
  1. **Diagnostics** (log / trace of startup and runtime). Name must
     describe the function; candidates: `pcfm-log`, `pcfm-trace`,
     `pcfm-diagnostics` (plural, coherent with `pcfm-stats`). Final name
     decided in the ADR, after local analysis.
  2. **Benchmark** (performance measurement on user hardware, target
     `00-foundations.md` §6: 60 fps UI, season < 60 s). **Deferred** — the
     targets are not measurable today (no UI, no L1). Revisit when the
     targets become measurable.
- **What is missing before any code:** a local reading of
  `crates/pcfm-test-runner/src/main.rs` and `crates/pcfm-testkit/src/lib.rs` to
  establish (a) what `pcfm-test-runner` actually does today beyond `--check`,
  `--list`, `--coverage`, (b) what the `Scenario` trait exposes, (c) what
  surfaces (if any) should move to a separate diagnostics crate.
- **Relationship with IDEA-INFRA-004:** that idea is about the **runner**
  (covering installed plugins and scenarios). It stays valid regardless of
  the runner crate name. The rename to `pcfm-test-runner` has already
  happened (ADR-020, 2026-10-28), and IDEA-INFRA-004 has been updated to
  match.
- **Open questions:**
  1. Does the diagnostics crate share the `Scenario` contract with the
     runner, or does it need a different one?
  2. Does `pcfm-test-runner` become a wrapper CLI with subcommands (`run`,
     `list`, `coverage`, `replay`, `inspect`), or stay a single-purpose
     binary? The `pcfm-demo` split is already done (ADR-020).
  3. Hooks: how many, for which concrete use case? (Discussion 2026-10-28:
     minimal, no generic hooks "for the future".)
- **Critical note:** an ADR is required before any crate is created or
  renamed, because the change touches the doctrine (dependencies,
  determinism, `pcfm-testkit` as contract). The doctrine wins. No code
  until the ADR is accepted.

### IDEA-INFRA-006 — TUI renderer (event-driven ASCII) for `pcfm-demo`
- **Status:** sketch
- **Category:** Infrastructure (rendering / validation)
- **Source:** conversation 2026-10-28 (user)
- **Idea:** a terminal UI that renders a match as ASCII: pitch, 22 players,
  ball, goals, score, updated on match events. A **validation renderer**,
  not L3-ui: it proves that the simulation/rendering split works with a
  second renderer, and it makes the match visible without leaving the
  terminal.
- **Where it lives:** `pcfm-demo` (name = function, per ADR-020). No new
  crate. `ratatui` + `crossterm`, or raw ANSI if we want zero dependencies.
- **What the data allows today:** the event chain has ~19 events per match,
  each with a minute (not a second). `PositionSnapshot` exists only on
  *attempt* events (ADR-019 D11), not every tick. So the TUI would show
  **discrete frames**, not smooth motion. The ball would jump, not roll.
  This is honest but limited. **Do not fake interpolation**: it would show
  movement the engine did not simulate, against pillar 5 (radical
  transparency).
- **Decision deferred to a short ADR:** whether the coarse granularity is
  acceptable for a prototype (likely yes), and — only if smooth motion is
  wanted — whether `MatchState::tick` should expose per-tick positions
  (which requires `SIM_VERSION` bump, a dedicated ADR, and a performance
  measurement, none of which exist today).
- **Open questions:**
  1. `ratatui`/`crossterm` or raw ANSI? (Dependency vs control.)
  2. Frame cadence: one frame per event, or a fixed tick?
  3. What is shown: pitch only, or pitch + score + event log?
  4. Is it a one-off prototype, or a maintained tool?
- **Critical note:** an ADR is required before code, because a second
  renderer touches the renderer contract
  (`simulation_is_shared_and_renderer_agnostic`). The ADR must say
  explicitly that this is a **validation prototype in `pcfm-demo`**, not
  the L3-ui (ADR-005 chose Qt for that), and that no engine change is
  planned.

### IDEA-TACT-001 — Tactics as per-state functions

- **Status:** sketch
- **Category:** Tactics
- **Source:** conversation 2026-10-29 (user, discussed)
- **Idea:** replace the classic zone-grid tactics model with a model where
  each player is assigned **functions** in two states (in possession, out of
  possession), plus a team-level **transition system** (not a third state with
  per-player functions). The map becomes **output** (derived), not input. The
  player flags functions; the system shows the resulting shape.
- **Two states + one system:**
  - **In possession:** per-player functions (ceiling 6-8, to be decided)
  - **Out of possession:** per-player functions (same ceiling)
  - **Transition:** team-level rule (counter-press / drop back / maintain
    shape / tactical foul), not per-player
- **Defaults:** each role provides a default function profile per state. The
  player starts from the profile and modifies it. Role remains an anchor, not
  a fixed prescription.
- **Validation:**
  - Hard errors: structural (11 players, no double assignment where
    functions conflict)
  - Soft warnings: competence estimates, incompatible combinations with
    explanation
- **Map:** output, derived from functions. The player does not place players
  on a grid; the system shows the resulting shape.
- **Relationship with IDEA-PRES-001:** this idea **revises** the tactics
  section of IDEA-PRES-001 ("three phases, each with its own zone
  assignment"). The rest of IDEA-PRES-001 (view model discipline, screens,
  order) is unchanged.
- **Pre-requisites:**
  - `L2-tactics` module (not yet written; ADR-019 deferred 9:
    "role -> tactic -> parameter chain")
  - ADR-019 D3: tactical instructions passed as named parameters. The
    function model must become parameters the engine understands.
  - Possibly a new ADR if the function model changes the parameter vocabulary.
- **Open questions:**
  1. How many functions per state? (Recommendation: 6-8, mutually exclusive
     or clearly compatible)
  2. How do functions relate to existing roles? (Anchor + deviation, or
     replace?)
  3. Familiarity/cohesion over time (attributable to tactic, not state) — in
     scope or deferred?
  4. What is the function vocabulary? (Closed enum, like ADR-019 D2, or open?)
  5. Is the derived map rendered by the TUI, or is a list enough for v1?
- **Critical note:** this is a **sketch**, not a decision. Do not implement
  until `L2-tactics` exists and a dedicated ADR (if needed) is accepted.

### IDEA-INFRA-007 — In-match intervention (manual pause, engine hints)

- **Status:** sketch
- **Category:** Infrastructure (interaction)
- **Source:** conversation 2026-10-29 (user, discussed)
- **Idea:** the manager can **manually pause** the match at any time, change
  the transition rule (or other pre-defined instructions), and resume. The
  engine **suggests** notable moments via hints (visible, not blocking), but
  never pauses on its own. The manager decides.
- **Separation from IDEA-INFRA-006:** this idea is about **interaction**; the
  renderer (IDEA-INFRA-006) is about **visibility**. The renderer must exist
  for the manager to see what to react to. They are separate concerns.
- **What the engine must provide:**
  - A **runtime input channel** that accepts commands from the renderer
  - **Recording of inputs as events in the save** (determinism: replay reads
    the same commands at the same ticks)
  - **Notable-transition events** (hints) at the engine's discretion —
    non-blocking, no automatic pause. Suggested triggers: possession loss in
    own third, recovery in opponent third, numerical superiority in
    transition. Whether these are hardcoded or plugin-provided is open.
- **What the renderer must provide:**
  - A visible, pausable view of the match (IDEA-INFRA-006 dependency)
  - A UI for issuing commands while paused
  - Display of hints as non-blocking notifications
- **Determinism:** every input is recorded in the save as an event. Replay
  is identical. The engine does not "know" whether the match is visible; it
  receives inputs as events like any other.
- **Pre-requisites (none exist today):**
  1. Runtime input channel (new ADR)
  2. Hook system for input (new ADR — ADR-012 mentions `MatchPlugin` but the
     hook shape is open; rule plugins in ADR-019 D11 produce outcomes from
     snapshots, not commands)
  3. Event granularity fine enough to make hints meaningful (~19 events/match
     today is too coarse — see IDEA-INFRA-006)
  4. Renderer that shows more than 19 frames per match (IDEA-INFRA-006)
  5. `SIM_VERSION` bump + performance measurement, if per-tick positions are
     exposed (IDEA-INFRA-006 decision, ADR required)
- **Open questions:**
  1. How many interventions per match? (No auto-budget; the manager is free.
     But does the engine warn after N? Does it record a counter?)
  2. Format of the hint / command UI (novice vs expert — expandable per the
     2026-10-29 discussion)
  3. How is the hint trigger vocabulary defined? (Closed enum, like D2, or
     open via plugins?)
  4. Does the assistant (IDEA-STAFF-001) also emit commands through this
     channel? If yes, ordering matters (manager vs assistant priority).
- **Critical note:** this is a **sketch**, not a decision. It depends on
  four prerequisites that do not exist today. Do not implement until they
  exist and dedicated ADRs are accepted.

### IDEA-STAFF-001 — Assistant manager and skip-match mode

- **Status:** sketch
- **Category:** Staff
- **Source:** conversation 2026-10-29 (user, discussed)
- **Idea:** a new kind of staff member, the **assistant manager**, with
  characteristics. When the player chooses to **skip a match**, the assistant
  manages the team for that match, making changes based on their
  characteristics. The player delegates and inherits the outcome.
- **Model B (opaque competence):**
  - **Observable (Plane B):** professional training, experience (matches
    managed, contexts).
  - **Latent (Plane A):** actual competence at in-match decisions. Lives in
    `pcfm-hidden`, never exposed.
  - **Estimated (Plane C):** reputation — a noisy signal of competence,
    correlated with but not identical to the latent. Influenced also by
    non-competence factors (visibility, team results, media sympathy).
- **Design constraints:**
  - Reputation must carry **significant noise**: the manager cannot estimate
    the latent with arbitrary precision by accumulating observations.
  - Reputation must not be a **doppelganger** of training + experience; it
    must add a partially independent signal.
  - The skip-match outcome is **uncertain by design**: the manager takes a
    risk by delegating.
- **What the assistant does (scope of skip-match):**
  - Manages the team using the pre-match tactic (set by the manager)
  - Makes in-match decisions (substitutions, transition rule changes) via the
    runtime input channel (IDEA-INFRA-007)
  - Deterministic: same characteristics + same context + same seed = same
    decisions
- **Relationship with the manager:**
  - The manager can be present and let the assistant act (delegation)
  - The manager can pause and override the assistant (IDEA-INFRA-007)
  - Priority: manager over assistant, per-tick
- **Relationship with ADR-019:**
  - If Model B, the assistant is a **new agent type** (not player, not
    referee, not peripheral-referee). It has a `Position`? No — it is not
    in-pitch. It is an **external agent** that emits commands via the input
    channel.
  - This is a type of agent that ADR-019 does not currently describe. It
    likely requires an ADR amendment or a new ADR.
- **Pre-requisites:**
  1. Plane A (ADR-003) for the latent competence
  2. Runtime input channel (IDEA-INFRA-007)
  3. New agent type or input-only agent, ADR amendment/extension
  4. `L2-staff` module (not yet written)
  5. Model B decision (if Model A: simpler, no latents, no ADR-003 impact)
- **Open questions:**
  1. How much signal vs noise in reputation? (Parameter to calibrate)
  2. Is there a hard cap on how precisely the latent can be estimated? (E.g.
     reputation update is slow, or noisy with a floor)
  3. Skip-match: is the assistant visible to the player, or is the match
     shown as if the manager were there? (UX question)
  4. Can the assistant disagree with the manager's pre-match tactic? (If yes,
     how is the disagreement communicated?)
  5. What happens to the assistant's reputation after a skip-match loss? (The
     manager should be able to blame the assistant — but can they?)
  6. How is the assistant hired? (Scouting, word of mouth, former players,
     etc.)
- **Critical note:** this is a **sketch**, not a decision. Do not implement
  until `L2-staff` exists, the runtime input channel exists (IDEA-INFRA-007),
  and the assistant agent type is decided (ADR-019 amendment or new ADR).
  Model A (transparent) is a simpler alternative if Model B turns out too
  costly.

### IDEA-PRES-001 — TUI-first presentation and view model
- **Status:** sketch
- **Category:** UX / Presentation
- **Source:** conversation 2026-10-28/29 (user)
- **Idea:** a terminal UI (TUI) as the primary form of presentation for PCFM,
  not as a fallback to a future GUI. The TUI reads a **presentation-level
  view model**: a stable, serializable projection of Plane C (estimation)
  and Plane B (observation), never Plane A (`pcfm-hidden`). The prototype
  runs around `pcfm-demo`, with deterministic mock data where L1/L2 does
  not yet exist.
- **Screens (prototype scope, 6 ceiling — 5 if finances is cut):**
  homepage (dashboard), squad, calendar, tactics, finances, staff
  (staff with two tabs: first team / academy, both filtered views on a
  single `StaffMember` collection with a `reparto` field).
- **Order of construction (by pressure on the view model, not by ease):**
  1. **Squad** — densest table, forces the choice of which fields exist
     and which are derived.
  2. **Tactics** — the only writable screen; introduces commands,
     validation, dirty state, undo/redo, spatial interaction.
  3. **Calendar** — introduces time as a dimension (past/future, state,
     next fixture).
  4. **Finances (or staff)** — numeric aggregation, formatting, locale.
  5. **Homepage** — **last**, because it aggregates all the others:
     building it first means inventing the data twice.
- **Tactics model (decisions from this discussion):**
  - **Three phases** (with ball, without ball, transition), each with its
    own zone assignment. Same 11 individuals across phases; positions may
    vary within role-compatible zones. Not a single tactic with views:
    three assignments on one shared zone grid.
  - **Zone + function**, not free positioning. Discrete grid (recommend
    5×3, named zones in UI, IDs in the model). The user does not move
    players: assigns players to primary zones and gives each a function
    per phase.
  - **Competence is an estimate (Plane C), not the latent (Plane A).**
    Each `(player, zone, phase)` has an estimated level + reliability +
    source. Own-team players are always "analysed" (high reliability but
    not perfect); other teams start unknown until a scout report. Colours
    and markers on the map are estimates, never facts.
  - **Heatmap:** observed (Plane B, from played matches) and estimated
    (Plane C, staff/scout). Both in the player screen, side by side, with
    a legend. Empty observed heatmap is a valid state (young player never
    fielded) and is displayed explicitly, not hidden.
  - **Hysteresis with decay:** competence rises slowly with practice,
    falls slower without it, with a non-zero floor (an ex-keeper remains
    a decent keeper). Shape of the curve is a model decision, mocked for
    the prototype.
  - **Validation:** hard errors (structural: 11 players, one zone per
    player, no double assignment) vs soft warnings (competence estimates).
    Warnings aggregated in the status bar, detailed per-zone.
- **View model rules (non-negotiable, the only binding part of this
  sketch):**
  - The UI reads a view model; it never reads `MatchState`, `Player`, or
    any `pcfm-hidden` type directly.
  - The view model projects Plane C and Plane B only. Plane A is never
    exposed.
  - The view model is serializable, so snapshot tests are deterministic.
  - The UI does not compute competence, ratings, or derived stats. If the
    UI needs a value, the view model must expose it.
  - Mocks live in a dedicated module, seeded deterministically, and are
    declared "mock" (not normative) in this sketch.
- **Responsive:** declared minimum (recommend 100×30 for the app, 120×35
  for tactics at full layout). Below the minimum, refuse with a clear
  message; do not adapt. Two or three breakpoints, each with "what appears
  here". Panels are not added at higher resolutions: they are revealed.
- **Social feed:** deferred. News of the world covers the "what happened"
  layer; social reactions require systems (fan sentiment, board pressure,
  player popularity) that do not exist yet. News = institutional facts
  derived from world state; social = reactions on those facts. Do not
  build the second without the first.
- **What this idea does not cover:** the match renderer
  (`IDEA-INFRA-006`), L3-ui (ADR-005), simulation changes
  (`SIM_VERSION` untouched), L1/L2 systems (finances, staff, youth are
  mocked).
- **Relationship with existing decisions:**
  - **`IDEA-INFRA-006`** is the match renderer inside `pcfm-demo`; this
    idea is the broader presentation layer that contains it. Neither
    replaces the other.
  - **ADR-005 chose Qt for L3-ui.** This idea proposes TUI-first as the
    primary presentation, which is in tension with that choice.
    Resolution requires re-reading ADR-005 and deciding: revise it, or
    reject this idea. **No code until ADR-005 is revisited.**
  - **ADR-019 D11** (`PositionSnapshot` on attempt events only) constrains
    the match renderer, not the rest of the presentation.
  - **If ADR-005 is revised:** a documentation pass is required on
    `README.md`, `PROJECT-STATUS.md`, `STRUCTURE.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`,
    `specs/00-foundations.md`. Do not update them before the ADR decision.
- **Open questions:**
  1. Competence estimate: per phase, or aggregated? (Per phase is more
     informative; aggregated is simpler.)
  2. Heatmap in the tactics screen, or only in the player screen?
  3. Grid: 5×3 named zones, or different?
  4. Minimum terminal size and breakpoints: which values, chosen against
     which content?
  5. Is the prototype a throwaway (delete after validation) or a seed
     for the future UI crate?
- **Critical note:** this is a **sketch**, not a decision. The only
  binding item is the **view model separation** (UI reads a projection,
  never the simulation). Everything else — layout, screens, mocks, order
  — is up for revision when L1/L2 exist and when ADR-005 is revisited.
  Do not implement from this idea until ADR-005 is resolved.

### IDEA-DOC-001 — Maturity statement in README
- **Status:** sketch
- **Category:** Documentation
- **Source:** audit report 2026-10-28-09-42, finding #6 (third-pass review)
- **Idea:** add a short "current maturity" block to `README.md` and `PROJECT-STATUS.md`, separating four status dimensions that today are mixed in prose: doctrine status, implementation status, ADR status, current test status. Goal: prevent a reader (human or AI) from inferring a higher maturity than the repo actually supports.
- **Open questions:** where exactly (top of README, or a dedicated `docs/MATURITY.md`); whether it is generated or hand-maintained; how to keep it from going stale (it is exactly the failure mode it is meant to prevent).
- **Critical note:** this is a documentation-hygiene idea, not a code change. Do not implement without an ADR only if it changes the doctrine; otherwise it is a doc task to schedule in `SESSION-STATE.md`.

### IDEA-DOC-002 — ASCII/ANSI style in documentation files
- **Status:** sketch (with critical note — likely reject)
- **Category:** Documentation / presentation
- **Source:** conversation 2026-10-31 (maintainer suggestion)
- **Idea:** since the project is TUI-first (ADR-022), replace emoji and other Unicode decoration in documentation files (README badges, `SESSION-STATE` status icons, `IDEAS.md` markers) with ASCII/ANSI equivalents, so that the docs visually reflect the TUI choice.
- **Open questions:** does any consumer read the `.md` files in a terminal? Is the emoji in `SESSION-STATE` operational readability (for the maintainer) rather than presentation of the game? What is the actual scale (how many files, how many occurrences)?
- **Critical note:** this is probably over-engineering today. ADR-022 concerns the game renderer (`pcfm-demo` TUI), not the project documentation, which is read on GitHub web where emoji render correctly. Replacing operational status icons (✅🔴🟡) with text labels would be a readability downgrade, not an alignment. D3: no concrete content today requires ASCII docs. Do not implement without a concrete consumer.

### IDEA-DOC-003 — Screenshot or GIF of the TUI in the README
- **Status:** sketch
- **Category:** Documentation / presentation
- **Source:** conversation 2026-10-31 (maintainer suggestion)
- **Idea:** add to `README.md` a screenshot, animated GIF, or ASCII capture showing the TUI renderer in action, so that the TUI-first choice is *shown* rather than *declared*. More effective than rewriting 60 documentation files.
- **Open questions:** static screenshot vs GIF vs terminal cast; where to host the asset (repo binary vs release artifact); how to keep it up to date as the TUI evolves.
- **Critical note:** depends on step 12 (TUI demo, IDEA-INFRA-006). Today there is nothing to capture yet. Do not implement before the TUI exists.

## Rejected ideas (for traceability)

### IDEA-REJ-001 — Drones over the pitch
- **Source:** conversation 2026-10-27 (user, then discarded)
- **Why rejected:** they clutter the view of the pitch; no gameplay value.

### IDEA-REJ-002 — Sensor in the ball
- **Source:** conversation 2026-10-27 (user, then discarded)
- **Why rejected:** unnecessary. The moment of contact is already the event timestamp. A sensor as a separate entity would be a complication without benefit.

### IDEA-REJ-003 — Player portraits in the TUI
- **Source:** conversation 2026-10-29 (user, then discarded)
- **Why rejected:** the TUI is the primary presentation, not a fallback. Portraits (procedural or asset-based) would move attention to a channel that carries no information, and would look like "almost a photo, but grainy" — the worst of both worlds. An icon of state (`[GK]`, `[DF]`, …) is fine and different. Revisit only if the presentation changes (GUI L3-ui).

### IDEA-REJ-004 — Real player names (including "initial + surname")
- **Source:** conversation 2026-10-29 (user, then discarded)
- **Why rejected:** legal risk (image rights include initials; a surname in context identifies a person) and doctrinal inconsistency (`00-foundations.md` §5: no invented real data, no bundling commercial data). The safe path is procedural, plausible names from `world_seed` + `player_id`. Real names only via an optional user-supplied pack, declared unofficial and never committed to the repo.
