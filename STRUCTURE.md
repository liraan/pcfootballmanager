# Repository Structure

**Version:** 1.8
**Status:** active
**Last updated:** 2026-10-26

This document explains how the repository is organised, and the rules that keep it coherent as it grows. Read it before adding a file, revising a module, or proposing a change.

---

## 1. The Documentation Model

The spec is **layered and concentric**, from abstract to concrete:

```
Doctrine  →  Modules (L0–L3)  →  ADRs  →  Code
   │              │                 │
   │              │                 └── one decision, one file
   │              └── one subsystem, one file, at one level
   └── the non-negotiable rules that everything else obeys
```

| Layer | Lives in | Purpose | Changes how often |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Doctrine** | `modules/00-foundations.md` | Why the project exists, the Three Planes, the banned things, the concentric model | Rarely. Only through a doctrine ADR. |
| **Modules** | `modules/L0-*/`, `L1-*/`, `L2-*/`, `L3-*/` | How one subsystem works, at one level | Often. Each has its own revision history. |
| **ADRs** | `docs/adr/NNN-*.md` | Why one architectural decision was made | Never edited after acceptance. Superseded by a new ADR. |
| **Plugins** | `crates/` + `sheet.toml` | A piece of code that extends the engine | Continuously, once the plugin system exists |
| **Code** | `crates/` | The implementation | Continuously, once it exists. |

**Rule:** a module may *reference* the doctrine but may not *restate* it. If a module contradicts the doctrine, the module is wrong, not the doctrine.

---

## 2. The Concentric Levels

The specification is not a flat list of 25 modules. It is organised in **four concentric levels**. Each level expands the previous one without replacing it. Dependencies flow **inward**: a level N may depend on levels `< N`, never on `> N`, never laterally.

**What "the game runs" means at each level:**

- **L0:** you can play a friendly match, save it, reload it, get the same result.
- **L1:** you can play a league season. Standings, calendar, results.
- **L2:** you can play a career. Transfers, budgets, youth intake, tactics, psychology, fans.
- **L3:** the game is moddable. Registry, packs, generator, editor, UI themes.

**Rules:**

- A level N module may **read** the output of a level `< N` module.
- A level N module may **not** read the internals of a level `< N` module.
- A level N module may **not** depend on a level `> N` module.
- The `00-foundations` doctrine applies at all levels.
- The Three Planes apply at all levels.

## 3. Directory Layout

### Terminology

Before the layout, the terminology. Three words, three things:

| Term | What it is | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Module** | A directory of the specification, at one level. Contains sub-modules. | `modules/L0-match/`, `modules/L2-psyche/` |
| **Sub-module** | A file inside a module. | `modules/L0-match/04-match-engine.md` |
| **Plugin** | A Rust crate with a `sheet.toml`, that extends the engine at runtime. | `crates/pcfm-match-3d/` (future) |

**A module is a document. A plugin is code.** The two are different things, and the terms are not interchangeable. The historical term **cell** is **deprecated**: it meant what is now called "module", and its use is discouraged in new text. The field `cell` in the frontmatter is a historical name: its value is the module directory name.

### Current state (as of 2026-10-27)

```

**File naming:** `NN-kebab-case-name.md`, two-digit prefix, no Italian, no version in the filename. `04-match-engine.md`, not `Modulo 04 — Motore Partita (rev 1.1).md`. The filename is stable; the revision lives in the frontmatter.

**Crate naming:** the crates in `crates/` use the `pcfm-` prefix. Current: `pcfm-core`, `pcfm-model`, `pcfm-hidden`, `pcfm-match`, `pcfm-stats`, `pcfm-testkit`, `pcfm-test-runner`, `pcfm-demo`, `pcfm-fixtures`. Planned (post-v1.0): `pcfm-packs`, `pcfm-assets`, `pcfm-pack`. `pcfm-testkit` is the public test harness contract: it has **no dependency on any other `pcfm-*` crate**, so core modules, plugins, and tools can all implement `pcfm_testkit::Scenario` without coupling. The historical prefix `fmr-` (from the original "FMR project" name) is deprecated and must not be used in new files. Rust module paths follow the same convention with an underscore: `pcfm_core::rng`, `pcfm_match::simulate`, `pcfm_testkit::Scenario`, etc.

**Modules vs sub-modules:** A **module** is a directory (`L0-match`, `L2-psyche`). A **sub-module** is a file inside a module (`04-match-engine.md`). A sub-sub-module is a section (`##`) inside a file. There is no third level of directories. If a sub-module needs its own children, it becomes a new module at the same level, not a deeper directory.

The field `module_id` in the frontmatter is the stable identifier of the sub-module (`L0.04`). The field `cell` is the name of the module directory (`L0-match`); the field name is historical, its meaning is "module directory". In prose, prefer "sub-module L0.04" when talking about a file, and "module L0-match" when talking about a directory. A **plugin** is a different thing: a Rust crate with a `sheet.toml`, defined in ADR-012.

### `/archive` — the history

Every superseded document goes here. Nothing is deleted. `Prompt_Master_v5.md`, `_v6.md`, `_v7.md` will live in `archive/prompts/` once recovered. When `00-foundations.md` is revised, the previous version is archived in `archive/doctrine/`. The four legacy Italian files (`01-architecture.md`, `02-registry.md`, `03-pack-system.md`, `04-data-model.md`) will be moved to `archive/legacy/` after migration (see `docs/MIGRATION-01-04.md`).

**Rule:** the archive is read-only. Do not edit archived files. They exist for traceability, not for maintenance.

### `/docs/adr` — the decision log

One file per architectural decision. See §5.

### `/docs/legal` — data source compliance

Licensing terms, provider constraints, what we can and cannot do with third-party data. *(planned — the directory exists but is empty)*

### `/docs/calibration` — model calibration dashboards

When the project ships, this folder holds the dashboards that compare internal models (xG, IR, projections) against real data. *(planned — the directory exists but is empty)*

### `/crates`, `/registry`, `/mods`, `/data`

`crates/` contains code (7 crates as of 2026-10-26). `registry/`, `mods/`, `data/` are empty until code or user packs exist. **Rule:** `data/` contains *examples only*. Never real licensed data. If you need to test with real data, keep it outside the repo.

---

## 4. Module Frontmatter

Every module (and every sub-module) starts with:

```yaml
---
title: "L0.04 — Match Engine"
level: 0
cell: "L0-match"
module_id: "L0.04"
version: "1.2"
status: "ratified"          # draft | review | ratified | superseded
last_updated: "2026-10-25"
supersedes: null             # or "previous-version-id"
depends_on:
  - "00-foundations"
  - "L0.01"
  - "L0.02"
  - "L0.03"
  - "L0.10"
referenced_by:
  - "L0.05"
  - "L0.06"
  - "L0.08"
  - "L0.09"
  - "L1-season"
conforms_to: "00-foundations (v1.1)"
---
```

**Field reference:**

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `title` | Human-readable title, includes the module ID |
| `level` | 0, 1, 2, or 3 (see §2) |
| `cell` | The module directory name (`L0-match`, `L2-psyche`, ...). Historical field name; the meaning is "module directory". |
| `module_id` | `L{level}.{NN}` for sub-modules |
| `version` | Semver-ish: bump minor for clarifications, major for invariant changes |
| `status` | `draft` (being written) / `review` (ready for comments) / `ratified` (stable) / `superseded` (replaced) |
| `last_updated` | ISO date |
| `supersedes` | The ID of the version this replaces, or `null` |
| `depends_on` | Module IDs this module reads from |
| `referenced_by` | Module IDs that read from this module |
| `conforms_to` | The doctrine version this module obeys. **Means "verified against", not "compatible with".** |

**Version policy:** bump the minor version for clarifications, the major version for changes that affect downstream modules. A major bump requires an ADR if it changes an invariant.

**`conforms_to` policy:** the field records the doctrine version the module was **verified against**. It is not bumped automatically when the doctrine changes for clarifications. It is bumped only when the module is re-verified (which happens when an invariant changes). See `modules/_index.md` §"Doctrine compliance" for the rationale.

---

## 5. The ADR Process

An Architecture Decision Record is a short document that captures **one decision**, its context, the options considered, and the consequences. It is **immutable once accepted**: to change a decision, write a new ADR that supersedes the old one.

### Format

```markdown
# ADR-NNN — Title

- **Status:** proposed | accepted | rejected | superseded
- **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **Supersedes:** ADR-XXX (if applicable)
- **Superseded by:** ADR-YYY (if applicable)
- **Blocks:** modules or code areas that cannot proceed until accepted

## Context
What is the problem? Why does it need a decision now?

## Options considered

### Option A — Name
- **Pro:** ...
- **Con:** ...

### Option B — Name
- **Pro:** ...
- **Con:** ...

## Decision
Which option was chosen, and why.

## Consequences
Easier / harder / locked in.

## Implementation notes
1. ...

## References
- ...
```

### Numbering

- `000-template.md` — the template
- `001` onwards — actual decisions
- Numbers are never reused. An ADR is never deleted.

### Open ADRs block code

If an ADR is `proposed` and touches an area, **no code may be written in that area until the ADR is accepted**. This is the rule that prevents the "we'll decide later" trap.

**This is the single source of truth for ADR status.** Other files (including `modules/_index.md`) show a derived view and defer to this table.

### Current ADR status

| ADR | Title | Status | Blocks |
|---|---|---|---|
| 001 | Language: Rust | ✅ accepted | — |
| 002 | Project name and scope | ✅ accepted | — |
| 003 | Plane A enforcement | ✅ accepted | — (unblocked L0.04, L0.08, L0.10) |
| 004 | Panic strategy at FFI | ✅ accepted | — |
| 005 | Qt binding | ✅ accepted | — (unblocked L3-ui, pcfm-bridge) |
| 006 | License | ✅ accepted | — (unblocked LICENSE.md, every Cargo.toml) |
| 007 | Canonical language | ✅ accepted | — (unblocked translations, language policy) |
| 008 | Provider integration is external | ✅ accepted | — (reclassified L2-ingest as external tool) |
| 012 | Plugins: The Brick Contract | ✅ accepted | Defines the plugin sheet, conflicts, narrative, cause traces, debug UI plugin view |
| 013 | Worlds: LOD, Manifest, and Local Determinism | ✅ accepted | Defines LOD, manifest, local determinism; revised pillar 1 of `00-foundations` |
| 014 | Mobile strategy | ✅ accepted | — |
| 015 | v1.0 scope | ✅ accepted | v1.0 content reduction (20 roles, 10 formations, 5 nations, 3 active psyche axes) |
| 016 | v1.0 content selections | ✅ accepted | Resolves ADR-015: 3 axes, 20 roles (catalogue in L1-roster), 10 formations, 5 nations (real cities), 7 L2 modules (crowd/media to v1.1). |
| 017 | Roles are labels, not modifiers | 🟡 proposed | Role catalogue in L1-roster; the engine is blind to roles |
| 018 | Defer crowd and media to v1.1 | ✅ accepted | Partially supersedes ADR-015: crowd and media ship in v1.1 |
| 019 | Match engine contract | ✅ accepted | Agent-first state in players, integer position, resolution as engine parameter, zone of influence as derived relation |

**Open ADRs:** 017 (proposed). **Accepted:** 001, 002, 003, 004, 005, 006, 007, 008, 012, 013, 014, 015, 016, 018, 019 (15).

**ADR-012 and ADR-013 are two halves of one decision.** Read them together, in order: [`PLUGINS-WORLDS-READING-GUIDE.md`](docs/PLUGINS-WORLDS-READING-GUIDE.md). ADR-013 depends on ADR-012.

**Note on pillar 1.** ADR-013 (accepted, 2026-10-25) superseded pillar 1 of `00-foundations` §2 and replaced the **global** determinism with **local** determinism (same save + same match + same plugin configuration = same result). `modules/00-foundations.md` v2.0 reflects this; pillar 1 now reads "local".

**Note on ADR-015.** ADR-015 (accepted 2026-10-26) formalises the v1.0 scope reduction. It depends on ADR-012 and ADR-013, both accepted. The specific selections were resolved in ADR-016 (accepted 2026-10-27); ADR-018 (accepted) partially supersedes ADR-015 for crowd and media.

---

## 6. Language Policy

**Canonical language for technical documentation: English.**

Rationale:

- The README is already English
- The project positions itself as an international community alternative
- Commit messages, code identifiers, and ADRs are English by convention
- A single language avoids the "which version is authoritative?" problem

**Translations:** Italian is the first planned translation, in `locales/it/`. Translations are maintained by volunteers, are marked with the English version they correspond to, and are **never** the source of truth. *(planned — the `locales/` directory does not exist yet)*

**This policy is itself a decision** and is ratified in **ADR-007**.

---

## 7. How to Add a New Module

1. Pick the level (L0, L1, L2, L3) the new module belongs to.
2. Check that the module does not violate the dependency rules in §2.
3. Create the directory `modules/L{N}-{kebab-name}/`.
4. Add `00-overview.md` with the frontmatter (see §4). The overview is the "border" of the module: it declares contracts, dependencies, DoD, risks.
5. Add the sub-modules as files inside the directory.
6. Add a row to `modules/_index.md`.
7. Open a PR with **one module only**.
8. After merge, update `referenced_by` in the modules that now reference it.

## 8. How to Revise an Existing Module

1. Bump `version` in the frontmatter. Minor for clarifications, major for invariant changes.
2. If major, write an ADR first (or link to an existing one).
3. Archive the previous version in `archive/` if the change is structural.
4. Update `last_updated`.
5. Open a PR with **one module only**.
6. If the revision changes a dependency, update `referenced_by` in downstream modules.

## 9. What Packs Can and Cannot Extend

The distinction is between **content** and **structure**.

| Packs **can** extend | Packs **cannot** extend |
|---|---|
| The **registry** (roles, formations, instructions, attributes, metrics, index models) — see `L3-registry` *(planned)* | The **modules** of the specification (L0–L3) |
| **Assets** (logos, kits, stadium images, audio) — see `L3-assets` *(planned)* | The **levels** of the concentric structure (L0, L1, L2, L3) |
| **Data** (squads, players, competitions, nations) — as provided or generated data | The **doctrine** (`00-foundations.md`) |
| **Configuration** (`balance/*.toml`, `theme/*.toml`) | The **frontmatter schema** of a module |
| **Scripts** in the sandboxed DSL (see `L3-packs` *(planned)*) | The **dependency rules** between levels |

**Rule:** a pack that needs a new module is a pack that is trying to be a different game. A new module is an **architectural decision**, not a content extension. It requires:

1. An ADR that justifies the new module (why does it exist? why is it not a sub-module of an existing module? why is it not a pack-provided registry entry?).
2. A PR to the core repository that adds the module, with frontmatter, DoD, and `_index.md` update.
3. A review by a maintainer.

This is not a restriction on moddability. It is a boundary between "modding the content" (welcome) and "modding the architecture" (welcome, but through a PR, not through a pack). The two are different activities, with different review needs.

**Examples:**

- A pack that adds a new role: **allowed** (registry extension).
- A pack that adds a new formation: **allowed** (registry extension).
- A pack that adds a new visual skin: **allowed** (asset extension).
- A pack that adds a new type of match event: **requires a core PR** (the `EventType` enum is in L0.05, and its extension is an architectural change).
- A pack that adds a new psychological axis: **requires a core PR** (the axis is in `L2-psyche`, and adding it changes the psyche model).

The last two examples are not "forbidden to modders". They are "not doable through a pack alone". The modder writes the PR, the core team reviews it, and if accepted, the new event type or axis becomes part of the core.

**Note on ADR-012 and ADR-013:** once ratified, the **plugin system** will allow a further form of extension, the **plugin**, which is a Rust crate that implements `MatchPlugin` and ships with a `sheet.toml`. See ADR-012 for the contract. The boundary above (content vs structure) is **unchanged**: a plugin is not a pack, and it requires a PR. A pack is a bundle of content, a plugin is a piece of code. Both are welcome, but they are different things.

## 10. What Does NOT Go in This Repo

- Real licensed data (Wyscout, Opta, StatsBomb, FBref scrapes)
- Credentials, API keys, tokens
- Executables, binaries, compiled artifacts
- Personal contact information of contributors
- Anything that would violate a provider's terms of service

---

## 11. The Honesty Rule

This project was drafted with AI assistance and is honest about it. That honesty applies to the documentation too:

- If a module is a stub, say `status: draft`.
- If a decision is open, say "open" and link to the ADR.
- If a date slipped, update the date and say so in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- If you don't know something, write "unknown" rather than inventing a plausible number.

A document that lies about its own state is worse than no document.
